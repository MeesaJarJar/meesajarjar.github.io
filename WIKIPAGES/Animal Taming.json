Higher levels in taming allow you to train much tougher creatures such as Dragons while lower level taming allows you to tame basic animals such as horses. Clicking on an animal once (if it's tamable) will bring up a \"Tame\" button, you will attempt to reason with the animal or monster until you either fail or succeed. If you succeed, the animal or monster will now listen to your typed commands (Listed below)\n\nYour Animal Taming and [[Animal Lore]] skills affect your ability to both tame the creature as well as command it. If your [[Animal Lore]] skill is too low, the creature will ignore your commands and get upset. Animal Taming allows you to acquire [[Meta Pets]].\n\n===Notes===\n* [[Power Scrolls]] and [[Skill Scroll]]s are available for this skill.\n* For a complete list of tameable creatures you can refer to the [[Tameables#Taming_Charts|Taming Charts]]\n\n==Recommended Training==\nAs one of the famously hardest skill to level, it is recommended to follow guides in order to maximize the Taming gains during training. Taming gains are difficulty based, meaning that you will not gain skill when Taming something that is considered too easy or too hard. Taming can also be passively trained whenever a tamed pet, or pets, kill a creature. The chance to gain is based on the relative strength of the pet used, the damage the pet dealt, and the tamers skill level. The [[Tameables#Taming_Charts|Tamed Creature's Minimum Taming Requirement]] must be within 5 skill points of the Tamer's current skill level. Relative Strength of your pet is based on the following:\n* Armor\n* Maximum Hitpoints\n* Strength\n* Dexterity\n* Skill levels\n* Special Abilities such as Relics or Boss Abilities\n\nNotes:\n* You cannot gain taming from gated mobs.\n\n==Guides==\n===Basic Guide===\nIn this guide, employing five tames consistently is highly recommended. The process involves two distinct phases: the battle phase and the tame phase, both of which you'll repeat multiple times. The rationale behind this strategy is that you earn 0.1 skill for each tame that successfully strikes an enemy before its demise.\n\nDuring the Battle Phase, you can acquire 0.5 skill per kill, making it a swift process to accumulate several skill points within minutes. Occasionally, you may find it necessary to conduct a manual tame phase to gain skill, usually yielding around 1.0 points, after which you'll return to the battle phase. It's crucial to ensure that each of your tames lands at least one hit during the battle phase to maximize skill acquisition. These skill points are visible in the show real, so ensure that this option is selected.\n\nFollowing the battle phase, it's advisable to release and eliminate your current tames. Whenever you require tames for a battle phase, they can be transferred to you from a GM+ tamer.\n\nYou can also create your own guide or modify these ones using the [[Tameables#Pet_Taming_Chart|list of tameable pets chart]]!\n\n===0-115 Guide===\nThe following guide was created by [https://www.uoforum.com/threads/fast-gm-animal-taming-11-23-2023.110252/ cliNt torreZ & Nokins] from the UOForever discord/forums. With this guide you can GM+ taming within a day or two of normal play. Like 8 or less hours of play. We have shared this with several people and they have found the great benefits of it with out having to spend 80+ hours trying to level it or millions of gold buying scrolls. Please enjoy.
