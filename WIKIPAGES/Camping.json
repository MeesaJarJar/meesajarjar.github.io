It's not often used since players can logout in Inns or safely in towns. It's considered one of those \"Useless\" skills such as [[Begging]] and [[Herding]]\n\n==Usage==\nIn order to create a camp, you require kindling to create a fire and a bedroll. Use the kindling and it will ignite, after the fire is lit, you will recieve a message stating that the camp is secure. You and anyone near you may then use the bedroll to log out.\n\n==Recommended Leveling==\n:0-50: Buy from NPC\n:50-100: Create camps (Kindling can be purchased from a provisioner)\n\n[[Category:Skills]]"
