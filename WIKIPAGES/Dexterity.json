The amount of [[dexterity]] a character has determines their total [[stamina]] which determines the rate of swing speed, ability to [[parrying]], and how long it takes to apply [[bandages]].\n\n===Notes===\nYou can allow or disallow your dexterity from gaining by double clicking your health bar and pressing the up or down arrow.\n\nYou can gain Dexterity in many ways. It can be raised passively through the use of combat skills. The easiest way to gain Dexterity is through [[Snooping]] or Music skills but most other skills will still passively raise [[dexterity]]."
