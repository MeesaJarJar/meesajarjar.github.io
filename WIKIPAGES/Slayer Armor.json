The chance of getting this bonus is scaled by the number of slayer pieces you have for that particular foe (e.g. if you have 2 pieces out of 6, then you only have a 33% chance of getting this 50% damage reduction). When you are hit by the corresponding slayer monster, a flash/sound occurs on your character, similar to using a slayer weapon.\n\nTo further explain the damage mitigation the following shall apply. Assume you were hit by a Flamestrike that did 40HP damage a full slayer suit would remove 50% of that damage making that Flamestrike do 20HP instead. If you were to have resisted that Flamestrike, from magic resist, then you would be hit for 20HP and the slayer armor would remove 50% making the spell do 10HP damage. This mitigation can be further reduced by the use of the Phylactery of Resilience which is one of the [[Meta Talismans]]. Also the use of a [[Tameables#Swamp_Dragon|Swamp Dragon]] will provide even more stacked benefit. In a perfect scenario with a max resilience talisman, exception swamp dragon, and full slayer suit you will only take 20% of the total 100% incoming damage.\n\n==How do I make it?==\nThanks to the knowledgeable researcher Blaine the Gypsy, we have the following information...\n\nSlayer armor can be created by placing glowing runes in a specific order inside a [[Crystal Workbench]]. So first you will need to acquire a crystal workbench.\n\nThe crystal workbench is created from crystals mined in a [[Random Dungeon Adventure]]. The crystals require 120 [[Mining]] skill to mine. It is not known at this time if mining gloves can be used as a buff to mine the crystals. Each crystal that is mined will provide one set of crystal shards used to create the workbench. After 10 shards, you will be able to craft a Crystal Workbench using the [[Tinkering]] crafting skill. The work bench can then be locked down in a house and used to create your slayer armor.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" class=\"right\">\nFile:TheWorkbench1.PNG|The Workbench\nFile:Workbench1.PNG|Workbench Gump\nFile:CrystalWorkbench1.jpg|Crystals to Mine\nFile:CrystalShard1.PNG|Crystals Shards \nFile:CrystalWorkBenchTinkering1.png|Tinkering Menu\nFile:CrystalWorkBenchTinkering2.png|Tinkering Materials\n</gallery>\n\nOnce you have acquired a crystal workbench then you will be able to utilize glowing runes with the workbench. So start farming those glowing runes!\n\nAny type of gargoyle kin will have a chance to drop glowing runes, but there are other monsters in the world that have dropped runes as well. Example, glowing runes can also be obtained from Monsters in a [[Random Dungeon Adventure]].\n\nEach glowing rune represents a letter from the gargoyle alphabet and using the recipes described above will tell you what order you should put the glowing runes inside the Crystal Workbench.\n\nYou will be able to click on runes to see \"which rune\" they are as they have a description of the letter they represent. Also the addition of the [[Slayer_Armor#Glowing_Rune_Reliquary|Rune Reliquary]], described below, really helps greatly to organize and pull runes out for later use.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" class=\"right\">\nFile:GlowingRunes1.PNG|Example of Glowing Rune\nFile:GargishAlphabet.png|Gargish Alphabet\nFile:SlayerArmor5.jpg|Example Armor\n</gallery>\n\nAfter the glowing runes have been placed in the correct order inside the Crystal Workbench, hit the 'imbue' button and click a piece of armor. You can imbue ANY existing armor (excluding blessed pieces) with a slayer property so it is best to imbue the best possible pieces of armor. <span style=\"color:red\">'''If the runes are placed in INCORRECT ORDER or NOT SPELLED CORRECTLY then YOU AND YOUR ITEM will both be DESTROYED.'''</span>\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=\"250px\" heights=\"250px\">\nFile:Benchdeath.gif|'''Workbench

types of Monsters there. No problem! You can put 2 slayer properties on ONE piece of armor! Check it out:\n\n[[File:SlayerArmor6.png]]\n\n==Glowing Rune Reliquary==\nTo make it easier to collect and pick out the appropriate runes, you can purchase a Glowing Rune Reliquary from Sasha the Unique Wares Vendor near West Britain Bank. It costs 250,000 gold pieces and holds up to 50 of each rune. A real time saver!\n\nThe chest has to be locked down in your house to be used. You can drop runes on it individually or drop a bag of runes on it and it will scoop them up and sort them for you. When you double-click the chest, you will be presented with a menu showing you how many of each rune you have. Each entry has an arrow next to it to allow you to take out one rune.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" class=\"right\">\nFile:Glowingrunechestgoldsink.png|Where to buy\nFile:Runechestlist.png|Chest menu\n</gallery>\n\n==Transmutation Cube==\nThe Transmutation Cube was added to the gold sink vendor at the price of 200k gold. This cube provides a way to use some of the lesser used glowing runes to create runes you want instead. There are two options for creating new glowing runes.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" class=\"center\">\nFile:TransmuteCube1.PNG|Where to buy\n</gallery>\n\nThe first is creating a random new rune by placing only <span style=\"color:red\">'''TWO'''</span> random runes into the cube and hitting '''transmute'''.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" class=\"center\">\nFile:TransmuteCube2.PNG|Random New Rune\n</gallery>\n\nThe second is creating a rune of your choice by placing only <span style=\"color:red\">'''FIVE'''</span> random runes into the cube and hitting '''transmute'''.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" class=\"center\">\nFile:TransmuteCube4.PNG|Rune of your Choice\nFile:TransmuteCube5.PNG|Selection Menu\n</gallery>\n\n\n==Old Slayer Armor History==\nA Gargoyle Alchemist used to drop recipes that would tell you what order the glowing runes would need to be placed in. These monsters no longer spawn in the world.\n\nThere are two types of Crystal Workbench. An old Pre-Patch workbench which cannot apply Silver recipe (\"nechra\"). At this time there are very few of these even remaining. Typically the only Pre-Patch workbench you may encounter would come as an IDOC loot drop from a very old house. You will need to contact a Game Master using the Help menu to get the workbench patched. \n\nThere are two ways to tell it is an old workbench, the old gump below and that it is unable to apply silver \"nechra\".\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" class=\"right\">\nFile:SlayerArmor1.jpg|Old Workbench Gump\nFile:SlayerArmor2.jpg|Old Research Document\n</gallery>\n\n[[Category:Items]]\n[[Category:Crafting]]"
