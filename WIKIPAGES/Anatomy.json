[[Anatomy]] can be raised by using the skill and selecting a creature or player or it will go up on its own as a player participates in melee or [[Archery]] combat. Anatomy levels up slightly faster from Melee and [[Archery]] combat against humanoid creatures.\n\n[[Anatomy]] is required for the [[Stun]] ability when combined with the [[Wrestling]] skill. See [[Wrestling]] for details about Stun.\n\n[[Anatomy]] is also taken into consideration when calculating the chances of a successful Stun for [[Wrestling]], Crushing Blow for [[Macing|Mace fighters]] using a two handed mace, Paralyzing Blow for [[Fencing|Fencers]] using a spear and Concussion Blow for [[Swordsmanship|Sword fighters]] wielding an axe. \n\nThe [[Anatomy]] and [[Evaluate Intelligence]] skills work together to provide a passive defensive wrestling ability. As it is passive, you do not have a chance to actively hit a player but it does provide a mitigation against incoming melee attacks. This can be used to avoid putting [[Wrestling]] on your Template.\n\n==Damage Enhancement==\nThe damage bonus from [[Anatomy]] is applied using this equation (Anatomy / 5) as a percentage (20% at 100 skill).\n\n==Healing Enhancement==\n60 [[Anatomy]] is required to Cure with [[Bandages]].\n80 [[Anatomy]] is required to [[Resurrect]] a player with [[Bandages]].\n\n== Recommended Training ==\n[[Anatomy]] can be trained by directly using the [[Anatomy|anatomy skill]] on another player or passively by using one of the following skills:\n:[[Swordsmanship]]\n:[[Macing|Mace Fighting]]\n:[[Fencing]]\n:[[Healing]]\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Stun]]\n*[[Wrestling]]\n*[[Swordsmanship]]\n*[[Macing]]\n*[[Fencing]]\n*[[Healing]]\n*[[Veterinary]]\n\n[[Category:Skills]]"
