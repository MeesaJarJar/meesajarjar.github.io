The maps require [[Cartography]] skill to decode at which point it will no longer say it is tattered but will display the location of the buried treasure chest. They can be obtained from various creatures as listed below.\n\nA map may decoded by another person, but the person digging up the map must still have the minimum required [[Cartography]] skill for the level of treasure map. [[Mining|Mining skill]] helps but is not required. To dig for a map, left click on the map and then click \"Dig for Treasure\" - This will allow you to remain mounted and escape swiftly if the going gets tough!\n\nAll treasure chests are trapped and [[Remove_Trap|Remove Trap skill]] will take care of it, but the skill is not required as many players simply cast [[Telekinesis]] on the chest to trigger the trap from a safe distance of five or more steps away.\n\nA high skill level in [[Lockpicking]] is useful as it vastly reduces the number of lockpick attempts required to open a chest.\n\n[[Mining|Mining skill]] is not required to dig up a treasure chest. However, the higher a character's [[Mining|Mining skill]], the further away from the exact spot they can be when attempting to dig up the chest. With no [[Mining|Mining skill]], the digger must be directly on the correct spot where the chest is buried. See [[Cartography]]\n\nIn combination with a rune library of treasure map locations, this map http://www.uoforever.com/map.php will help you find the hidden treasures!\n\n[[File:Yd3eSQQ.png]]\n\nhttp://www.uoforever.com/map.php | Interactive map for Treasure Map Chests locations and numbers.\n\n==Loot & Spawns==\nAll monsters that spawn with the digging of the chest or spawn from looting items from within the chest are subject to becoming [[Paragons|Paragons]] which can significantly increase the difficulty of the treasure map. Keep these [[Paragons|Paragon]] chances in mind before attempting a map level based on the listed monsters below, but also keep in mind that [[Paragons|Paragons]] of the monsters can drop a [[Paragons#Paragon_Chests|Paragon Chest]] which has a guaranteed treasure map inside!\n\nIn addition to to the listed gold, magic items, reagents and gems, treasure map chests also have a chance to contain:\n* [[Wands]] - a very high chance for [[Item_Identification#Item_Identification_Wand|Item Identification Wands]]\n* [[Random_Dungeon_Adventure#Fragments|RDA Fragments]] - The higher the map, the greater the chance. Note that these portal fragments share the same graphic ID as star sapphires but have a different Color Hue (1161).\n* [[Meta_Talismans#Relic_Qualities|Meta Talisman Crumbling Relics]] or [[Meta_Pets#Relic_Qualities|Meta Pet Crumbling Relics]] - Up to 20% drop chance at Level 7\n* [[Antique_of_the_Artisan#Mythical_Crafting|Mythical Crafting Recipes]] - Level 7 Tmaps only but 100% chance to drop!\n* [[Dimensional_Archway##Dyeing_Archways|Dimensional Archway Dye deed]] - Level 7 Tmaps only\n\n\n{| cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" width=\"100%\"\n! style=\"background-color:#000; color:#FFFFFF;\" | Level\n! style=\"background-color:#000; color:#FFFFFF;\" | Title\n! style=\"background-color:#000; color:#FFFFFF;\" | Cartography Skill\n! style=\"background-color:#000; color:#FFFFFF;\" | Lockpicking Skill\n! style=\"background-color:#000; color:#FFFFFF;\" | Gold\n! style=\"background-color:#000; color:#FFFFFF;\" | Magic Items\n! style=\"background-color:#000; color:#FFFFFF;\" | Spawned Monsters\n|- align=\"center\"\n|1\n|Plainly\n|0\n|52\n|1000-1500\n|6, <br>[[Meta_Talismans#Relic_Qualities|Meta Talisman Crumbling Relics]] or [[Meta_Pets#Relic_Qualities|Meta Pet Crumbling Relics]]\n|Headless One, Mongbat, Ratman, Skeleton, Zombie\n|- align=\"center\"\n|2\n|Expertly\n|41\n|72\n|2000\n|12, <br>[[Meta_Talismans#Relic_Qualities|Meta Talisman Crumbling Relics]] or [[Meta_Pets#Relic_Qualities|Meta Pet Crumbling Relics]]\n|Earth Elemental, Gazer, Gargoyle, Hell Hound, Orc Mage\n|- align=\"center\"\n|3\n|Adeptly\n|51\n|84\n|3000\n|18, <br>[[Meta_Talismans#Relic_Qualities|Meta Talisman Crumbling Relics]] or [[Meta_Pets#Relic_Qualities|Meta Pet Crumbling Relics]]\n|Air Elemental, Dread Spider, Fire Elemental, Lich, Ogre Lord\n|- align=\"center\"\n|4\n|Cleverly\n|61\n|92\n|4000\n|24, <br>[[Meta_Talismans#Relic_Qualities|Meta Talisman Crumbling Relics]] or [[Meta_Pets#Relic_Qualities|Meta Pet Crumbling Relics]]\n|Elder Gazer, Daemon, Dread Spider, Lich Lord, Ogre Lord\n|- align=\"center\"\n|5\n|Deviously\n|70\n|95\n|5000\n|30, <br>[[Meta_Talismans#Relic_Qualities|Meta Talisman Crumbling Relics]] or [[Meta_Pets#Relic_Qualities|Meta Pet Crumbling Relics]]\n|Blood Elemental, Elder Gazer, Daemon, Lich Lord, Poison Elemental\n|- align=\"center\"\n|6\n|Ingeniously\n|70\n|95\n|6000\n|36, <br>[[Meta_Talismans#Relic_Qualities|Meta Talisman Crumbling Relics]] or [[Meta_Pets#Relic_Qualities|Meta Pet Crumbling Relics]]\n|Ancient Wyrm, Balron, Blood Elemental, Greater Dragon, Poison Elemental, Titan\n|- align=\"center\"\n|7\n|Insidiously\n|100\n|100\n|12000\n|?, <br>[[Meta_Talismans#Relic_Qualities|Meta Talisman Crumbling Relics]] or [[Meta_Pets#Relic_Qualities|Meta Pet Crumbling Relics]],<br>[[Antique_of_the_Artisan#Mythical_Crafting|Mythical Crafting Recipes]], Archway Dyes\n|Succubus, Revenant Lion, Werewolf, Balron, Ancient Shadow Wyrm\n|}\n\n===Notes:=== \n* [[Meta_Talismans#Relic_Qualities|Crumbling Relics]] drop chance has been reduced as per patch notes March 5th , 2023: [https://www.uoforum.com/threads/8-7-4-0-notification-updates-minor-fixes-and-tons-of-extra-backend-logging.110178/ 8.7.4.0 - Notification updates, minor fixes, and tons of extra backend logging.]\n* Level 7 Treasure maps can only be obtained from [[Monster Contracts]] and [[Paragons|very high level paragon monsters (mainly bosses)]].\n\n==Gear==\nThere are several items available to help regular treasure map hunters collect and sort through their map collection.\n\n===TMap Book===\nA blessed book that holds up to 32 treasure maps, deciphered or not. If they are deciphered, a view option will appear for the map. You will have to remove the map from the book to dig up the treasure. Being blessed, this is a convenient item for anyone to have to safely store the treasure maps you collect while killing monster. The book is available for 100,000 gold pieces from the Sascha the Unique Wares Vendor just west of West Britain Bank\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" class=\"right\">\nFile:TmapbookView.png|TMap Book Interface\nFile:TmapbookVendor.png|TMap Book Vendor\n</gallery>\n\n===Map Storage Cabinet===\nStores undecoded treasure maps and keeps track of completed ones as well. 125 of each map level can be stored. The cabinet can be purchased for 300,000 gold pieces from Sascha the Unique Wares Vendor.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" class=\"right\">\nFile:TmapcabinetInterface.png|Map Storage Cabinet Interface\nFile:MapstoragecabinetVendor.png|Map Storage Cabinet Vendor\n</gallery>\n\n===Davies' Locker===\nThis giant locker can hold up to 500 treasure maps and [[Message in a Bottle|MIB's]].
