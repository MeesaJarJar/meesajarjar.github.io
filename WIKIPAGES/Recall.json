[[Rune]]s can be purchased from the mage shop and locations can be marked with the [[Mark]] spell while standing in the desired location.\n\nCast the [[Recall]] spell from your spell book or use a [[Recall]] scroll, then target the marked [[Rune]]. You will be teleported to that location. You can also open a [[Runebook]] and simply click on the spell icons shown at each location. (Note: You may also cast recall on [[Ship Rune]]s in the same fashion) [[file:Open_Runebook.png|thumb]]\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Gate Travel]]\n*[[Rune]]s\n*[[Runebook]]s\n*[[Mark]]\n\n[[Category:Magery Spells]]"
