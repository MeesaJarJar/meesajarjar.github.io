This allows them to [[Recall]] or [[Gate Travel]] to it later.\n\nCasting [[Mark]] requires Black Pearl, Blood Moss and Mandrake Root and costs 20 [[Mana]].\n\nThe words spoken when casting [[Mark]] are Kal Por Ylem and it's a Sixth circle spell.\n\n==Usage==\nTo [[Mark]] the location where you are standing, you will need a blank [[Rune]]. [[Rune]]s can be purchased from the mage shop. Cast the [[Mark]] spell and click on the [[Rune]]. Double click the [[Rune]] and type in the name of the location. This location is now stored within the [[Rune]] and can be traveled to with the [[Gate Travel]] and [[Recall]] spells.\n\nCast the [[Recall]] spell from your spell book or use a [[Recall]] scroll, then target the marked [[Rune]]. You will be teleported to that location. You can also open a [[Runebook]] and simply click on the spell icons shown at each location. (Note: You may also cast recall on [[Ship Rune]]s in the same fashion) [[file:Rune_Felucca.png|thumb]]\n\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Magery Spells]]\n*[[Recall]]\n*[[Gate Travel]]\n*[[Rune]]s\n\n[[Category:Magery Spells]]"
