They are available via the [[Tinkering]] menu and can only be applied to runic blacksmith weapons. Unlike normally crafted slayers, the deed applies a limited number of slayer charges to the runic weapon and will break when the charges are exhausted. 105 Tinkering is required to be able to create these deeds. The success chance will show 0% but you still have a very small chance to craft them. It is recommended to not attempt crafting these until you're at least at 115 skill. \n\nSlayer deeds are also usable on wooden exceptionally crafted weapons as long as they have at least two magic attributes.\n\nSuper Slayers where changed with this addition to do 20% less damage then the lesser slayer weapon categories.\n\n[[File:SlayerDeeds.png|center|Slayer Deed Menu]]"
