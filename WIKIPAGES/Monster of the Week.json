As you may have guessed, the monster changes every week! This may seem familiar to its predecessor Monster of the Month, but this has a brand new player driven raffle system for selecting the following weeks monster. How this system will work is as you kill monsters labeled \"Monster of the week\" you may find a drop called a \"Monster of the week redemption token\"\n\n[[image:MotWticket.PNG]]\n\nWhat this token scroll will allow you to do is vote each week on a raffle-type system on what the following week's monster should be for the entirety of that week.\n\n[[image:motwMenu.PNG]]\n\nYou will be able to vote as many times as you want, all you need is the tokens.\nEach Sunday at around 8pm EST the votes will tally up as a raffle and the new monster of the week will be announced server wide.\nThey are sellable/tradeable.\nOnce a monster has been chosen, that same monster cannot be chosen again for (3) weeks.\nEach monster choice has their own new unique hue and other rares.\n\n==Announcements==\n\nThe current monster of the week can be found anytime by visiting Atta the Ecologist and double clicking on him. This will give you a message that states the current [[Monster_of_the_Week#Monsters|Monster of the Week]] along with a picture of the monster. Atta the Ecologist is located near the [[Britain|West Britain Bank(WBB)]].\n[[image:Monster_of_the_week_map_atta.JPG|right]]\n[[image:Monster_of_the_week_atta_the_ecologist.JPG|left]]\n[[image:Monster_of_the_week_messsage.JPG|center]]\n\n==New Loot System==\nThis loot system allows us to update any type of loot on any monster on the fly without reboots or coding right across the board.\n\n<gallery class=\"left\" widths=\"250px\" heights=\"250px\">\nFile:LootSystem.gif|'''New Loot System'''<br />(click to preview)\n</gallery>\n\nWe are implementing a new Item Rarity System which will display rarity of items on the following scale:\n\n* Junk\n* Poor\n* Common\n* Uncommon\n* Magical\n* Rare\n* Epic\n* Legendary\n* Mythical\n* Artifact\n* Relic\n* Celestial\n\nBased on the rarity there will be different colors that are displayed. If you play other popular MMOs this is probably not a foreign concept to you. With exception of a few items we will not be adding Item Rarities to previous items until AFTER the rising expansion is completely finished. We will be taking suggestions for item rarities, to be implemented at a later date.\n\n==Rewards==\nIn addition to their normal loot, the Monster of the Week can drop:\n* [[Meta_Pets#Meta_Dragon|Meta Dragon Crumbling Relics]]\n* [[Meta_Pets#Meta_Steeds|Meta Steed Crumbling Relics]]\n* [[Meta_Talismans|Meta Talisman Crumbling Relics]] \n* [[Skill_Scroll|Skill Scrolls]]\n* [[Titles_and_Hues_Guide|Title Scrolls]]\n* MOTW Hued Spellbook\n* MOTW Hued Cloth\n* MOTW Hued Chests\n* [[Dimensional_Archway##Dyeing_Archways|Dimensional Archway Dye deed]]\n* Special Rare Drops depending on the Monster chosen for the week\n\n==Monsters==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! align=\"center\" | Monster\n! align=\"center\" | Hue\n! | Drops\n\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align:center;\"\n| Ice Fiend\n| 2170 (Heavenly)\n| <gallery mode=\"packed\">\nimage:Icefiends2170Heavenly.PNG\nFile:Archway_Hue_2170.PNG\n</gallery>\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align:center;\"\n| Dragon\n| 1955 (Black Scarlet)\n| <gallery mode=\"packed\">\nimage:Dragons1955BlackScarlet.PNG\nFile:Archway_Hue_1955.PNG\n</gallery>\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align:center;\"\n| Terathan Warrior\n| 1924 (Toxic)\n| <gallery mode=\"packed\">\nimage:TerethanWarrior1924Toxic.PNG\n</gallery>\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align:center;\"\n| Ogre Lord\n| 1919 (Black Cherry Merlot)\n| <gallery mode=\"packed\">\nimage:OgreLord1919BlackCherryMerlot.PNG\nFile:Archway_Hue_1919.PNG\n</gallery>\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align:center;\"\n| Titan\n| 2151 (Polished Bronze)\n| <gallery mode=\"packed\">\nimage:Titan2151Polishedbronze.PNG\nFile:Archway_Hue_2151.PNG\n</gallery>\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align:center;\"\n| Lich Lord\n| 1666 (Whitewash)\n| <gallery mode=\"packed\">\nimage:LichLord1666Whitewash.PNG\n</gallery>\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align:center;\"\n| Succubus\n| 2190 (Rosetta Angel)\n| <gallery mode=\"packed\">\nimage:Succubus2190RosettaAngel.PNG\n</gallery>\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align:center;\"\n| Earth Elemental<br>(Applies to all Ore Elementals)\n| 2181 (Ancient Bronze)\n| <gallery mode=\"packed\">\nimage:EarthElemental2181Ancientbronze.PNG\n</gallery>\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align:center;\"\n| Orcish Lord\n| 1913 (Gorlab Green)\n| <gallery mode=\"packed\">\nimage:OrcishLord1913GorlabGreen.PNG\n</gallery>\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align:center;\"\n| Ophidian Knight-errant\n| 2179 (Shangri-la)\n| <gallery mode=\"packed\">\nimage:OphidianKnightErr2179Shangrila.PNG\n</gallery>\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align:center;\"\n| Lizardman\n| 2177 (Sphene)\n| <gallery mode=\"packed\">\nimage:Lizardman2177Sphene.PNG\nFile:Archway_Hue_2177.PNG\n</gallery>\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align:center;\"\n| Daemon\n| 2191(Peruvian Silk)\n| <gallery mode=\"packed\">\nimage:Daemon2191PeruvianSilk.PNG\nFile:Archway_Hue_2191.PNG\n</gallery>\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align:center;\"\n| Ratman\n| 2148 (Apatite)\n| <gallery mode=\"packed\">\nimage:Ratman2148Apatite.PNG\n</gallery>\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align:center;\"\n| Dread Spider\n| 2186 (Fuchsia)\n| <gallery mode=\"packed\">\nimage:DreadSpider2186Fuchsia.PNG\n</gallery>\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align:center;\"\n| Evil Mages\n| 1975 (Relvinian Red)\n| <gallery mode=\"packed\">\nimage:Motw_reward_hue_1975_folded_cloth.PNG\n</gallery>\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align:center;\"\n| Ettins\n| 1988 (Two-headed Truffle)\n| <gallery mode=\"packed\">\nimage:Motw_reward_hue_1988_folded_cloth.PNG\n</gallery>\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align:center;\"\n|}\n\n==Contributors==\nThe community would like to thank the following brave adventurers who contributed their time and experiences for others to enjoy:\n* Lunaris"
