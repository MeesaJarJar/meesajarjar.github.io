The Meta Talisman gives warrior, archer, and mage style players special abilities as their talisman levels. Each talisman has a passive property and active abilities that are obtainable through relics. The talisman levels up as you kill creatures and the [[#Relics_and_Abilities|abilities]] of your talisman become stronger.\n\nThe more recently added Shadow of the Rogue talisman does not require a user to run through the Quest Line but is instead available from the Gold Sink vendor in Britain.\n\nWith these bonuses come some limitations:\n* The talisman cannot be equipped by any character with greater than 50 in any bard skills (e.g. music, provocation, peacemaking, discordance) or greater than 50 taming. Currently there is a bug to where you must be below 49.0 skill with any bonuses provided from your [[Status|Strength, Dexterity, or Intelligence]] instead of the Real Skill of 50. \n* The talisman skills and bonuses are not applicable against other players or pets.\n* Talisman experience and relic ability gains are not possible in houses.\n* Upon equipping a talisman there is a fifteen minute cool down before the skills or bonuses become active. To avoid this cool down, you can return to the Ancient Statue of Power and speak the words \"I wish to pay tribute\" which will take 10,000 gold pieces from your bank.\n<gallery widths=300px heights=50 perrow=2>\nFile:Meta_talisman_rest_awhile_message.PNG| The message \"You must rest before channeling talisman power again.\" comes when a Meta Talisman has been deactivated, either by becoming recently un-equipped or being involved in PVP. There is a 15 Minute Cooldown before this Talisman can become active again, or you can pay tribute to the Statue West of the Shrine of Valor for 10,000 gp by saying \"I wish to pay tribute\".\nFile:Meta_talisman_icy_chill_message.PNG| The message \"You feel an icy chill as your talisman drains of some of its power.\" will appear if you or Monsters within homes are targeted.\n</gallery>\n\n==Training Meta Talismans==\nThe [[Meta_Talismans#Description|Meta Talismans]] grow in power as you use them, much like any skill in Ultima Online. They are level based with experience points required for each level in order to progress to the new bonuses for the new level. This experience is gained passively by having an activated talisman equipped on your [[Paperdoll]] and doing damage to valid animals or monsters. This damage is converted into experience and applied to the current level each time damage is done to the creature. Each talisman has a different bonus for each level, as well as, specific rules/restrictions on experience gain so be sure to refer to the specific talismans below!\n\n[[File:Meta_talisman_experience.PNG|500px|Phylactery of Resilience Meta Talisman]]\n\nMeta Talismans also have [[#Relics_and_Abilities|abilities]] that can be applied and also grow in power as you use them. Relics have levels which require experience, however the way experience is gained is specific to the Relic which can be by activating the relic or doing something while a Relic is activated. Levels and experience are tracked individually for each applied Relic and once the experience for that Relic Level's Maximum has been reached the Relic will gain additional bonuses. Relics do not have standard experience requirements per level, each Relic will have a different number of experience required before it will reach the next level. Currently the highest level for any Relic is 10.\n\n===Notes===\n* There is a maximum experience amount per creature that can be awarded to a given talisman. The bigger the creature, the greater the experience!\n* There are [[Consumable_Perks#Perks|Consumable Perks]] that can be used to increase experience gain while leveling.\n* During Special Events where Double Experience is given, the [[Consumable_Perks#Perks|Consumable Perks]] bonus is additive, which means that using Perks during these times will set your bonus to Triple Experience for the duration of the perk.\n* Talisman experience and relic ability gains are not possible in houses.\n* You can no longer gain XP if you have not cast a spell or melee attacked a mob within the last 3 minutes.\n* Upon equipping a talisman there is a fifteen minute cool down before the skills or bonuses become active. To avoid this cool down, you can return to the Ancient Statue of Power and speak the words \"I wish to pay tribute\" which will take 10,000 gold pieces from your bank. \n<gallery widths=300px heights=50 perrow=2>\nFile:Meta_talisman_rest_awhile_message.PNG| The message \"You must rest before channeling talisman power again.\" comes when a Meta Talisman has been deactivated, either by becoming recently un-equipped or being involved in PVP. There is a 15 Minute Cooldown before this Talisman can become active again, or you can pay tribute to the Statue West of the Shrine of Valor for 10,000 gp by saying \"I wish to pay tribute\".\nFile:Meta_talisman_icy_chill_message.PNG| The message \"You feel an icy chill as your talisman drains of some of its power.\" will appear if you or Monsters within homes are targeted.\n</gallery>\n\n==Relics and Abilities==\nAbilities are applied to the talisman by finding relics at events, dungeon bosses, monster of the month spawns and at the [[Dungeon_Bosses#Arch_Demon|Arch Demon]] and Lich Khan dungeon bosses. Each talisman has a maximum of four relic slots and aesthetic relic slots. The aesthetic slots are usable at any time and you get relic slots at levels: 1, 4, 7, 10.\n\n[[File:tread_relic.png|Example Relic]]\n\nThere are currently four or five unique relics for each type of talisman which are detailed further below. Each relic has ten levels and leveling may lower the skill cooldown, raise the chance to activate, or provide other ability specific bonuses. These abilities typically have a random chance to activate on damage and a cooldown to only allow them to be activated at certain intervals.\n\nTo add a relic to your talisman, double click the relic and then select your talisman. Be sure to stand in a safe place while doing this as relics can be stolen!\n\nWith the recent change you are now able to swap your active relics, double click your Meta Talisman and then click on the [ - ] symbol next to the relic you wish to remove from the active relic list (highlighted in yellow in screenshot). Once you have an open unused slot available you will be able to hit the [ - ] symbol next to relics in the inactive list to make it an active relic (highlighted in red in screenshot). Keep in mind if you swap frequently in a short amount of time it will put it into cooldown.\n\n[[File:RelicSwap2.PNG|275px|Relic Swap]]\n\nNote that you will have to be quite lucky for all your talisman's relics drop for you. You may need to frequent the [http://www.uoforum.com/forums/buying.14/ Buying] and [http://www.uoforum.com/forums/selling.15/ Selling] forums to find your relics. Keep in mind that certain relics are more popular than others and can therefore be expensive to purchase. Being part of a larger guild can also provide a useful avenue for getting relics at a reduced rate.\n\n===Relic Qualities===\nRelics will have 4 qualities; Crumbling, Flawed, Perfect, and Flawless(currently not yet available!). Relics will now have separate Maximum Level Thresholds based on their Quality Level, and can be used to increase to a current maximum level of an equipped relic, and now be used with different [[Power Scrolls]] amounts based on quality level on [[Meta_Talismans#Relic_Fragments|Relic Fragment Systems]]. The [[Slayer_Armor#Transmutation_Cube|Transmutation cube]] can be used to convert 8 Crumbling Relics of the '''SAME QUALITY TYPE''' into a Flawed Relic version, however be extremely careful to make sure that all 8 Crumbling Relics are of the same quality and belong to the same type of Relic otherwise '''YOU WILL LOSE ALL ITEMS IF THE RECIPE FAILS!!!'''.\n\nThe Known Relic Qualities are:\n* '''Crumbling Relic''' - Will increase a current maximum relic level by 1, up to level 6. Can be used as 1 [[Power Scrolls|Power Scroll]] worth of points on relic fragment systems.\n* '''Flawed Relic''' - Will increase a current maximum relic level by 2, up to level 10. Can be used as 10 [[Power Scrolls]] worth of points on relic fragment systems.\n* '''Perfect Relic''' - Will increase a current maximum relic level to 10, and will not go beyond level 10. Can NOT be used as points on relic fragment systems.\n* '''Flawless'''(not currently yet available!) - Will increase a current maximum level by 1. Can only be used from level 10 to level 15. Can be used as 20 [[Power Scrolls]] worth of points on the relic fragment system.\n\n[[File:MetaTalismanRelicQualitiesCrumbling.PNG|An Imbueologist Relic of Crumbling Quality.]]\n[[File:MetaTalismanRelicQualitiesFlawed.PNG|An Imbueologist Relic of Flawed Quality.]]\n\n[[File:MetaTalismanRecyclerRelicCrumblingAdd.gif|Meta Talisman Relics can be used to add to the maximum level of your current relic. This is a Recycler Relic of \"Crumbling Relic\" quality being applied to the Antique of the Artisan. Here the Maximum level is being increased from 2 to 3.]]\n\n===Relic Fragments===\n:'''Small Relic Fragments'''\n::Small Relic Fragments can be used to build Relics of [[Meta_Talismans#Relic_Qualities|Crumbling Relic Quality]]. Small Relic Fragments will have a specific Relic they originally belong to and start with 1 point in their Relic Fragment System. These Small Relic Fragments can be used to absorb [[Power Scrolls]] to add 1 point to their Relic System, or absorb Relics for points listed in [[Meta_Talismans#Relic_Qualities|Relic Qualities]]. \n\n::[[File:MetaTalismanRelicQualitiesSmallFragment.PNG|An Imbueologist Relic Small Relic Fragment.]]\n\n:'''Relic Fragments'''\n::There are other Relic Fragments can be purchased from the Gold Sink Vendor that can be used with the [[Meta_Pets#Meta_Spider|Meta Spider Pet]], [[Meta_Pets#Meta_Crab|Meta Crab Pet]], or [[Meta_Pets#Meta_Mantis|Meta Mantis Pet]]. Relic Fragments will have a specific Relic they originally belong to and start with 0 points in their Relic Fragment System. These Relic Fragments can be used to absorb [[Power Scrolls]] to add 1 point to their Relic System, or absorb Relics for points listed in [[Meta_Pets#Relic_Qualities|Relic Qualities]]. Each Relic Fragment may have a different total amounts to reach before they can be applied to a [[Meta_Pets#Meta_Spider|Meta Spider Pet]], [[Meta_Pets#Meta_Crab|Meta Crab Pet]], or [[Meta_Pets#Meta_Mantis|Meta Mantis Pet]] and you can read more about the relic totals in their respective sections.\n\n::[[File:MetaTalismanRelicNecrosisRelicFragment.PNG|A Necrosis Relic Fragment and Brood Relic Fragment.]]\n\n===Relic Changes===\nContent releases that has come after the 10th Anniversary has brought some changes to the way relics gain levels, where they come from, and new functionality such as combining different relics together. This is a community driven FAQ to cover all the changes related to a Major Patch releases:\n* January 25th, 2023: [https://www.uoforum.com/threads/8-7-0-0-major-patch-crafter-talisman-relic-update-housing-biowners-and-more.110164/ 8.7.0.0 - Major Patch - Crafter Talisman, Relic Update, Housing Biowners and more]\n* February 6th, 2023: [https://www.uoforum.com/threads/8-7-2-0-classic-housing-upgrade-talisman-dye-and-crafting-achievement-fixes-more.110168/ 8.7.2.0 - Classic Housing upgrade, Talisman Dye, and Crafting Achievement Fixes.. & More]\n* February 26th, 2023: [https://www.uoforum.com/threads/server-update-8-7-3-0-tons-of-talisman-relic-updates-rogue-talisman-provisional-update-and-more.110169/ Server update 8.7.3.0 - Tons of Talisman Relic updates, Rogue Talisman Provisional update, and more.]\n* March 5th, 2023: [https://www.uoforum.com/threads/8-7-4-0-notification-updates-minor-fixes-and-tons-of-extra-backend-logging.110178/ 8.7.4.0 - Notification updates, minor fixes, and tons of extra backend logging.]\n\n====What changed about relics?====\nRelics now have four levels: Crumbling, Flawed, Flawless (not yet released), and Perfect. Perfect relics are those which are unchanged from the recent update...spider, archery, and rogue relics.\n\n====What do the different levels mean?====\nWhen a relic is applied to a talisman or pet, it starts with zero experience and a maximum level cap. That level cap is determined by the level and number of relics you have applied.\n*Crumbling relics add +1 to the relic level cap, up to a max of level six.\n*Flawed relics add +2 to the relic level cap, up to a max of level 10.\n*Flawless relics will add +1 to the relic level cap, from level 11 to level 15 (not currently available).\n*Perfect relics will add +10 to the relic level cap, to a max of level 10.\n\nRelics added must be of the same type. For example, if you have a tread relic with a level cap of 2, you need to add more tread relics to increase the level cap.\n\nRelics can gain experience past their level cap, but will not exceed their current max. For example, if your relic is at 2/2 and says 0/1600 xp, you can still earn xp until it says 1600/1600 but cannot proceed to the next level until you have applied another relic to increase your cap to 2/3.\n\n====I hear that relics will be able to go as high as level 15. How do I do that?====\nThat is a separate change coming at an undetermined date in the future. When that happens, flawless relics will be added which will increase your relic level cap by +1 and is the only relic type that can be used to increase level caps beyond 10.\n\nOnce that change is implemented in the future, a typical progression would look like this: six crumbling relics to have a level cap of six, two flawed relics to increase the level cap to 10, then five flawless relics to reach a final level cap of 15.\n\n====If I already had a relic applied to my talisman before this update, did anything change?====\nNo. If you already had a relic applied to your pet or talisman before this update, you already had a relic level cap of 10 and that did not change. This change only applied to relics that were not already applied to a pet or talisman.\n\n====Do the new relic types also raise my current level?====\nNo. The relics simply increase the level cap of the relic, they do not replace the experience that has to be earned to achieve each level.\n\n====Which relic types can be used to charge spider relics?====\nAny! Now both pet and talisman relics can be used to charge spider relics. Crumbling relics are equivalent to 1 [[Power Scrolls|Power Scroll]], flawed relics are equivalent to 10 [[Power Scrolls]], flawless relics will be equivalent to 20 [[Power Scrolls]], perfect relics (spider, archery, rogue) cannot be used to charge spider relics.\n\n====How do I find these relics?====\n:'''Craft Relics'''\n::[[Bulk_Order_Deed#Rewards|Bulk Order Deed turn-ins]] will have a chance to drop [[Meta_Talismans#Relic_Fragments|small relic fragments]] for the [[Antique_of_the_Artisan|Artifact of the Artisan]]. The character turning in the [[Bulk_Order_Deed|Bulk Order Deed]] must have the [[Antique_of_the_Artisan|Artifact of the Artisan]] equipped to have a chance at [[Meta_Talismans#Relic_Fragments|small relic fragments]]. The chance of getting a [[Meta_Talismans#Relic_Fragments|small relic fragment]] from [[Bulk_Order_Deed#Rewards|Bulk Order Deed turn-ins]] is about 1%.\n\n::[[Meta_Talismans#Relic_Fragments|Small relic fragments]] can be combined with additional [[Meta_Talismans#Relic_Fragments|small relic fragments]] to create a [[Meta_Talismans#Relic_Fragments|crumbling relic]]. Each fragment is worth one point and a total of 12 need to be combined to make the [[Meta_Talismans#Relic_Qualities|Crumbling Relic]]. [[Power_Scrolls|Power scrolls]] and other relics can also be added to a [[Meta_Talismans#Relic_Fragments|small relic fragment]] to create a [[Meta_Talismans#Relic_Qualities|Crumbling Relic]]. [[Power_Scrolls|Power scrolls]] are equivalent to one point, [[Meta_Talismans#Relic_Qualities|Crumbling Relics]] are equivalent to 1 point, and [[Meta_Talismans#Relic_Qualities|Flawed Relics]] are worth 10 points. [[Meta_Talismans#Relic_Qualities|Perfect Relics]] cannot be combined with small relic fragments.\n\n::When [[Meta_Talismans#Relic_Fragments|small relic fragments]] are combined, the final [[Meta_Talismans#Relic_Qualities|Crumbling Relic]] that is created will match the fragment which you double clicked. For example, if you double click [[Antique_of_the_Artisan#Recycler|a small Recycler Relic fragment]] and target 11 [[Antique_of_the_Artisan#Imbueologist|small Imbueologist Relic fragments]], the resulting [[Meta_Talismans#Relic_Qualities|Crumbling Relic]] will be a [[Antique_of_the_Artisan#Recycler|Recycler Relic]] type.\n\n:'''Other Relics:'''\n::[[Monster_of_the_Week|Monster of the Week mobs]], [[Idol_of_Forbidden_Magic#Graveyards|World Objectives (such as necromancer cemetery mobs)]], [[Treasure_Map|Treasure Maps]], [[Message_in_a_Bottle|Messages in a Bottle]], [[Whirlpool|Whirlpools]] and [[Paragons|Paragon Chests]] have a chance to drop [[Meta_Talismans#Relic_Qualities|Crumbling Relics (not including crafting relics)]]. The chance of getting a [[Meta_Talismans#Relic_Qualities|Crumbling Relic]] can include either Meta Talisman Relics and [[Meta_Pets| Meta Pet Relics]].\n\n::[[Dungeon_Bosses|Dungeon Bosses]] and [[Champion_Spawns|Champion Bosses]] have a chance to drop [[Meta_Talismans#Relic_Qualities|Flawed Relics]].\n\n::[[Meta_Talismans#Relic_Qualities|Flawed Relics (all types)]] can also be created by using the transmutation cube (available on the gold sink vendors) and a new recipe to combine 8 [[Meta_Talismans#Relic_Qualities|Crumbling Relics]]. The 8 [[Meta_Talismans#Relic_Qualities|Crumbling Relics]] must all be of the same type.\n\n::It is unknown at this time how [[Meta_Talismans#Relic_Qualities|Flawess Relics]] will be obtained.\n\n====Have the aesthetic relics changed at all?====\nYes! Previously, aesthetic relics could be applied to a talisman at any time and meta pets that had met specific level requirements. Now, aesthetic relics can be applied to a talisman or meta pet at any time, no matter what level they are. Aesthetic relics cannot be used to charge spider relics or combined with small relic fragments to create crumbling relics.\n\n==Activatable Relics==\n===Activatable Macro Commands===\nWhile most Relics are passively used, meaning that you do not have control over when a Relic will Proc, some Relics(such as the [[Meta_Talismans#Relics_5|Artifact of the Marksman Relics]]) are now having the ability to be manually activated with a newly added \"Relic Ability Macro\". Here is an overview on how to add these new macro commands to your client:\n<gallery widths=500px heights=300px perrow=2>\nFile:Activate_Abilities_By_Slot_1_Ability_3_Macro.png| Click on options on your paper doll and click the Macros tab. Create a new macro and then set it up like this (using whatever hotkey you want)\nFile:Artifact_of_the_Marksman_Activate_Abilities_By_Slot_1_Ability_3_Macro.png| Here is the Example Scenario for the following Instructions.\n</gallery>\n\n'Slot 1' is just the talisman itself so make sure you always choose Slot 1. The ability number depends on where the relic is in the order from top to bottom on the talisman. As you can see on mine, Concussive Blast is the fourth relic down.\nBut, it's the third relic that has an active ability so I've chosen 'Ability 3' in the second dropdown menu above. The game doesn't count Reclamation because that has a passive ability and doesn't need to be activated to work. So because I chose 'Ability 3' for this macro, the macro is going to look for the third active relic and use that one. If my relics were in a different order, such as concussive blast, reclamation, knee strike, then volley and I want the macro to activate concussive blast, I'd choose 'Ability 1' because it is the first active relic in the list. If I wanted a macro/hotkey for volley in that scenario, I'd choose 'Ability 3'. Even though volley would be fourth down in the list, it's only the third active relic so it needs to be 'Ability 3'.\n\n===Activatable Menu Bar===\nThere is also a Menu Bar for Activatable Relics which will fill up for you to click on when your Meta Talisman detects a Relic with an Activatable Ability. In this example you will see the [[Meta_Talismans#Relics|Vivify Relic]] which is an Activatable Relic that needs to choose a valid Summoned Pet in order to be used.\n* If you can't find your Abilities Menu, you can find it in your client options, Combat-Spells, Then \"Reset the Abilities Menu Position\" button at the bottom.\n<gallery widths=500px heights=300px perrow=2>\nFile:MetaTalismanRelicActivatableMenu.PNG| The Activatable Relic Menu showing the Activatable Relic \"Vivify\" which is a clickable button that will bring up a crosshair to use on a summoned pet.\nFile:MetaTalismanRelicVivifyActivatable.PNG| The Vivify Relic in use with the Activatable Menu.\n</gallery>\n\n==Aesthetic Relics==\nAs mentioned there are currently four different aesthetic relics that apply to your Meta Talismans or [[Meta Pets]]. Pets require to be either a max evolution dragon (after feeding it fruit), at least a level 6 spider, or at least a level 6 steed.\n\nAesthetic relic activation percentage is essentially an average of all aesthetics currently applied and online. The average percentage of having all four online is 10%. This means 10% of your kills will result in one of the four activating, they can not double activate on the same kill.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=\"250px\" heights=\"250px\">\nFile:AscensionGIF.gif|'''Ascension Relic'''<br />(click to preview)\nFile:BloodyExplosionGIF.gif|'''Bloody Explosion Relic'''<br />(click to preview)\nFile:ChickenDinnerGIF.gif|'''Chicken Dinner Relic'''<br />(click to preview)\nFile:CombustionGIF.gif|'''Combustion Relic'''<br />(click to preview)\n</gallery>\n\n'''The new Aesthetic relics are here!''' Below you will see how to obtain each of the four relics. Ascension is on the donation vendor Nadine. Bloody Explosion is gained as a reward from doing monster contracts for Heracles. Chicken Dinner is on the gold sink vendor Sasha. Combustion is a drop from defeating the Warden boss in [[Asylum]].\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=\"250px\" heights=\"250px\">\nFile:AscensionVendo.PNG|'''Ascension Vendor'''<br />(Donation Coins)\nFile:BloodyExploVendo.PNG|'''Bloody Explosion Vendor'''<br />(Contracts)\nFile:ChickenDinnerVendor.PNG|'''Chicken Dinner Vendor'''<br />(Gold Sink)\nFile:CombustionBoss.PNG|'''Combustion Relic Boss'''<br />(Warden Boss Drop)\n</gallery>\n\n==Quest Line==\nBe forewarned, the quest to obtain a Meta Talisman is not for the impatient, frugal or faint of heart! To begin the multi-part quest you must travel just west of the Valor Shrine where the Forgotten Warrior statue awaits:\n\n[[File:Talisman_statue.png]]\n\nIn order to begin a questline with the Forgotten Warrior statue, you will need to stand on the tile by the foot of the statue and speak any words to it:\n\n[[File:MetaTalismanQuestlineSpeakToTheStone.PNG]]\n\nYou can then select one of the quests listed in this popup menu:\n# [[Meta_Talismans#The Art of War|The Art of War]]\n## [[Meta_Talismans#Idol_of_the_Magi | Idol of the Magi (Mage Tali)]]\n## [[Meta_Talismans#Phylactery_of_Resilience | Phylactery of Resilience (Defense Tali)]]\n## [[Meta_Talismans#Totem_of_the_Berserker | Totem of the Berserker (Zerker Tali)]]\n## [[Meta_Talismans#Artifact_of_the_Marksman | Artifact of the Marksman (Archer Tali)]]\n# [[Antique_of_the_Artisan#Questline|Lessons of the Past]]\n## [[Antique_of_the_Artisan| Antique of the Artisan (Crafter Tali)]]\n\n===The Art of War===\nThe Art of War is a test of Valor in which you must prove your worth as a true warrior. You must first sacrifice your most powerful weapons, then slay 100 Evil Creatures and finally fearlessly enter the Daemon Archlord's Lair. To track your progress the Forgotten Warrior has given you a stone in which to empower with your deeds of Valor.\n# '''Surrender Your Weapons:''' You are given a dull stone that must be empowered with Vanquishing weapons. This stone absorbs a Vanquishing weapon's power by double clicking this stone and targeting the weapon. The stone can only be charged with true instruments of war... daggers, cleavers, knives and pitchforks cannot power it. Once 30 Vanquishing weapons have been absorbed by the stone, you must return to the Forgotten Warrior Statue and present yourself with this empowered stone.\n# '''Slay Evil Creatures:''' The Forgotten Warrior witness your stone and tell you to prove yourself by slaying 100 \"evil\" creatures. These creatures must have a minimum fame level to be accepted by the stone. Creatures of this stature include Dragons, Drakes, Daemons, Ogre Lords, Lich Lords, Deep Earth Elementals, Orc Mine Overseers, Paragon Lichs etc. The level of \"evilness\" is determined by the monster's health points which must be 400 or higher. Some Deep Earth Elementals, for example, will be just below the required level of \"evil\" because they have less than 400 health points. Once you've killed those creatures and the stone is filled, return to the statue and speak again.\n# '''Enter the Daemon Archlord's Lair:''' Now you have to visit the Daemon Archlord's lair! Also known as the [[Dungeon_Bosses#Arch_Demon|Arch Demon]], he is located in Wrong on level 3. In the center of the room you will find a small red statue. Double click that to collect the Arch Demon's blood. Be cautious however, if the Arch Demon is around, you will have a hard time getting to the statue! If you want to take on the boss himself, it is recommended that you familiarise yourself with his attack mechanics first.\n# '''Choose your Path:''' With the Arch Demon's blood in your bag, double click your stone and select the blood to purify the stone. Now you can speak once more to the statue with your purified stone and you will be able to choose one of the four talismans:\n## [[Meta_Talismans#Idol_of_the_Magi | Idol of the Magi (Mage Tali)]]\n## [[Meta_Talismans#Phylactery_of_Resilience | Phylactery of Resilience (Defense Tali)]]\n## [[Meta_Talismans#Totem_of_the_Berserker | Totem of the Berserker (Zerker Tali)]]\n## [[Meta_Talismans#Artifact_of_the_Marksman | Artifact of the Marksman (Archer Tali)]]\n\n====Notes====\n* You may complete the quest multiple times on one character but you will only be able to wield one talisman at a time.\n* When killing these Evil Creatures, you need to the source of damage that obtains looting rights in order for the kill to count. You cannot use Summons(such as energy vortex or bladed spirits) or Pets/Hirelings.\n\n===Lessons of the Past===\n[[File:AntiqueOfTheArtisanLessensOfThePastQuest.PNG|500px]]\n\nLessons of the Past is a test of Valor in which you must prove your dedication to the arts as a Mythical Craftsman. You must first consult with the Spirits of Great professions of the Past to gain their knowledge and then gain their extraordinary powers into your skilled hands. You must then sacrifice corresponding resources to the tools enchanted by these great Spirits. Only after all the Spirits of the Great Professions are sated, will the Forgotten Warrior provide you with a Talisman of Power.\n# '''Spirits of Great Profession:''' The statue will tell you to visit the spirits of great professions of the past, which will imbue your stone into a tool. Each Spirit is in a location famous for its trade skills, the first is the blacksmith located at the [[Britian_Crafting_Area]]. These spirits will only be visible to you if you are on that part of the questline, no one else will see these spirits. You will need to absorb their knowledge into your stone by double clicking the stone and selecting the Spirit.\n## [[File:AntiqueOfTheArtisanEmenatingAnvil.PNG|265px]][[File:AntiqueOfTheArtisanLessensOfThePastQuestSpiritBlacksmith.PNG|335px]][[File:AntiqueOfTheArtisanLessensOfThePastQuestSpiritBlacksmithCapturedMessage.PNG|275px]]\n# '''Sacrifices to the Tool:''' The spirits will require a sacrifice of the type of resources commonly used in their great profession. The first is ingots to the blacksmithing profession, which you will have to provide all the ingots requested to the tool by double clicking the tool and selecting a pile of ingots from your bags or from the bank box. \n## [[File:AntiqueOfTheArtisanEmenatingAnvilFilled.PNG]][[File:AntiqueOfTheArtisanLessensOfThePastQuestSpiritBlacksmithSacrificedIngotsMessage.PNG|310px]]\n# '''Repetition, Consistency, Success:''' Once this is fulfilled you will need to show your dedication to the Forgotten Warrior and they will appoint your another Spirits of Great Profession to track down and sacrifice the corresponding resources to the tool used by the Spirit of the Great Profession. Once all 8 Great professions have been pacified with the ritual the Forgotten Warrior will offer you the [[Antique_of_the_Artisan|Antique of the Artisan Talisman of Power]].\n## [[File:AntiqueOfTheArtisanLessensOfThePastQuestOfferingTalismanOfPower.PNG|335px]]\n\n====Notes:====\n* When looking for the Spirits, they will be found inside a building related to their profession. They will only be visible to you(and others on the same step) and invulnerable, so check for yellow names!\n* When sacrificing resources, you can place the resources in the bank and then use the tool to target the stack in your open bank.\n\n===Abandoning a Questline===\nYou can abandon a previously empty or partially completed questline by using the [[Context_Menus|context menu]] and selecting the \"Abandon Quest\".\n\n[[File:MetaTalismanQuestlineAbandonQuestlineDropdown.PNG]]\n\nAfter the context menu option has been selected you will see a prompt that will require you to type \"I Agree\" into the field then select \"Continue\".\n\n[[File:MetaTalismanQuestlineAbandonQuestline.PNG]]\n\n== Idol of the Magi == \n[[File:magetali.png|right]] \n\nThe Idol of the Magi, also known as Meta Mage, provides a spell damage bonuses and mana cost reduction for offensive spells. The relics also provide more ways to reduce mana costs, boost damage and use summons to tank through the active use of vivify to heal and return mana to your summons. [[Meta_Talismans#Relic_Qualities|Flawed Talisman Relics]] can be found as possible drops from [[Dungeon_Bosses|Dungeon Bosses]] while [[Meta_Talismans#Relic_Qualities|Crumbling Talisman Relics]] can be found on [[Monster_of_the_Week|Monster of the Week mobs]], [[Idol_of_Forbidden_Magic#Graveyards|World Objectives (such as necromancer cemetery mobs)]], [[Treasure_Map|Treasure Maps]], [[Message_in_a_Bottle|Messages in a Bottle]], [[Whirlpool|Whirlpools]] and [[Paragons|Paragon Chests]].\n\n===Benefits===\n====Amplified Damage====\nIdol of the Magi increases offensive spell damage as the Talisman levels levels by 20% per level.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! align=\"center\" | '''Level'''\n! align=\"center\" | '''Bonus Spell Damage'''\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 1\n| align=\"center\" | 20%\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 2\n| align=\"center\" | 40%\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 3\n| align=\"center\" | 60%\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 4\n| align=\"center\" | 80%\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 5\n| align=\"center\" | 100%\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 6\n| align=\"center\" | 120%\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 7\n| align=\"center\" | 140%\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 8\n| align=\"center\" | 160%\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 9\n| align=\"center\" | 180%\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 10\n| align=\"center\" | 200%\n|}\n\n====Mana Reduction====\nIdol of the Magi offers a few ways to reduce mana cost which is calculated by the talisman level, number of relics applied, and spirit speak:\n* ([[Spirit Speak|Spirit Speak Skill]]/4)% e.g.: 25% mana reduction at 100 Spirit Speak, 12.5% at 50.\n* (Talisman Level)% e.g.: 1% at level 1, 10% at level 10. \n* Bonus 10% reduction when four relics are enabled. \n* These bonuses are all additive, meaning if you have [[Spirit Speak|GM Spirit Speak]], a level 10 Talisman, and four Relics enabled, your spell's cost will be reduced from 45% (mana costs are rounded up to the next whole number!)\n* It is also worth noting the Relic Transcendence reduces the base cost of spells by (relic level), which these percentage reductions then apply to.\n\n===Leveling===\nTalisman experience is gained through damage that gets converted into experience. The levels are calculated with a \"Base Value\" and a \"Per Level Power\" in the formula: \"Base Value\" * (Level ^ \"Per Level Power\"). The Base Value for the talisman is 10000 and the Per Level Power is a factor of 1.3. The following table explains the experience required to gain Talisman Levels:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! align=\"center\" | '''Level'''\n! align=\"center\" | '''Experience Required'''\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 1\n| align=\"center\" | 10,000\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 2\n| align=\"center\" | 24,623\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 3\n| align=\"center\" | 41,712\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 4\n| align=\"center\" | 60,629\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 5\n| align=\"center\" | 81,033\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 6\n| align=\"center\" | 102,706\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 7\n| align=\"center\" | 125,495\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 8\n| align=\"center\" | 149,285\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 9\n| align=\"center\" | 173,986\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 10\n| align=\"center\" | 199,526\n|}\n\n====Penalties====\nWhile leveling, your talisman experience gains are reduced if you are wearing armor. The penalty is 1.6% per AR. There is however no range penalty for Meta Mages. You can therefore stand at a safe distance while firing your lightning bolts at those big ugly creatures! \n\n=== Spirit Speak ===\nSpirit Speak reduces the cost of spells. With the talisman at level 10 with four relics applied an energy bolt will cost as little as 10 mana with 100 Spirit Speak, 14 mana with 50 Spirit Speak and 16 mana with 0 Spirit Speak.\n\n=== Relics ===\nIdol of the Magi has 5 relics available and you can enable up to 4 at a time depending on the Talisman's level. This talisman has two types of relics: active and passive. Passive relics provide advantages or abilities by simply having them enabled on your talisman. Active Relics can be used by selecting them from your Talisman Ability Gump. [[Meta_Talismans#Relic_Qualities|Flawed Talisman Relics]] can be found as possible drops from [[Dungeon_Bosses|Dungeon Bosses]] while [[Meta_Talismans#Relic_Qualities|Crumbling Talisman Relics]] can be found on [[Monster_of_the_Week|Monster of the Week mobs]], [[Idol_of_Forbidden_Magic#Graveyards|World Objectives (such as necromancer cemetery mobs)]], [[Treasure_Map|Treasure Maps]], [[Message_in_a_Bottle|Messages in a Bottle]], [[Whirlpool|Whirlpools]] and [[Paragons|Paragon Chests]]. \n\n====Dispersion====\n'''Relic Type:''' Passive\n\n'''Proc Chance:''' Greater than 10%\n\nDispersion provides a chance for spell damage to be dispersed to nearby enemies. There is a 10% chance for an offensive spell to damage level-dependent number of creatures within a 3 tile radius. At level one, the damage can disperse onto one additional creature and the cool down is 60 seconds. At level ten, the damage can spread to up to ten additional creatures and the cool down is 45 seconds. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! align=\"center\" | '''Level'''\n! align=\"center\" | '''Experience Required'''\n! align=\"center\" | '''Cooldown'''\n! align=\"center\" | '''Additional Creatures'''\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 1\n| align=\"center\" | 200\n| align=\"center\" | 60\n| align=\"center\" | 1\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 2\n| align=\"center\" | 546\n| align=\"center\" | 58\n| align=\"center\" | 2\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 3\n| align=\"center\" | 984\n| align=\"center\" | 56\n| align=\"center\" | 3\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 4\n| align=\"center\" | 1,493\n| align=\"center\" | 55\n| align=\"center\" | 4\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 5\n| align=\"center\" | 2,063\n| align=\"center\" | 53\n| align=\"center\" | 5\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 6\n| align=\"center\" | 2,688\n| align=\"center\" | 51\n| align=\"center\" | 6\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 7\n| align=\"center\" | 3,361\n| align=\"center\" | 50\n| align=\"center\" | 7\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 8\n| align=\"center\" | 4,079\n| align=\"center\" | 48\n| align=\"center\" | 8\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 9\n| align=\"center\" | 4,838\n| align=\"center\" | 46\n| align=\"center\" | 9\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 10\n| align=\"center\" | 5,637\n| align=\"center\" | 45\n| align=\"center\" | 10\n|}\n\n====Focus====\n'''Relic Type:''' Passive\n\n'''Proc Chance:''' 95%\n\nFocus provides a chance for increased spell damage. Spell damage can do (Focus Level / 20)% additional damage to the target creature. For example, at level 1, this would be 5% (1/20)% additional damage. An offensive spell that hits for 100 will therefore generate an additional 5 damage, shown as a separate damage number. In the same scenario, at level 10, focus can generate an additional 50 spell damage. The Focus relic cooldown begins with a base of 35 seconds and falls 2 seconds per relic level for a total of 15 seconds at Level 10. The chance of activation is 95% after the cooldown expires.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! align=\"center\" | '''Level'''\n! align=\"center\" | '''Experience Required'''\n! align=\"center\" | '''Cooldown'''\n! align=\"center\" | '''Bonus Damage'''\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 1\n| align=\"center\" | 200\n| align=\"center\" | 35\n| align=\"center\" | 5%\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 2\n| align=\"center\" | 546\n| align=\"center\" | 32\n| align=\"center\" | 10%\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 3\n| align=\"center\" | 984\n| align=\"center\" | 30\n| align=\"center\" | 15%\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 4\n| align=\"center\" | 1,493\n| align=\"center\" | 28\n| align=\"center\" | 20%\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 5\n| align=\"center\" | 2,063\n| align=\"center\" | 26\n| align=\"center\" | 25%\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 6\n| align=\"center\" | 2,688\n| align=\"center\" | 23\n| align=\"center\" | 30%\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 7\n| align=\"center\" | 3,361\n| align=\"center\" | 21\n| align=\"center\" | 35%\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 8\n| align=\"center\" | 4,079\n| align=\"center\" | 19\n| align=\"center\" | 40%\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 9\n| align=\"center\" | 4,838\n| align=\"center\" | 17\n| align=\"center\" | 45%\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 10\n| align=\"center\" | 5,637\n| align=\"center\" | 15\n| align=\"center\" | 50%\n|}\n\n====Shadow Disciple====\n'''Relic Type:''' Passive\n\n'''Proc Chance:''' Very Low\n\nShadow Disciple provides a chance to return some mana and temporarily lower the resist of creatures that are casted upon. Mana recovery is calculated by: (damage * (10.0 + (Level * 2.0)) / 100.0). The resist of the target is modified by: resist * (1.0 - (((Level * 2) + 10.0) / 100.0)). The Cooldown starts at 1 minute and reduces 2 seconds per level. It has a very low proc chance.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! align=\"center\" | '''Level'''\n! align=\"center\" | '''Experience Required'''\n! align=\"center\" | '''Mana Recovery'''\n! align=\"center\" | '''Target New Resist'''\n! align=\"center\" | '''Cooldown'''\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 1\n| align=\"center\" | 200\n| align=\"center\" | 12% of damage done\n| align=\"center\" | 88% of maximum\n| align=\"center\" | 60 seconds\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 2\n| align=\"center\" | 546\n| align=\"center\" | 14% of damage done\n| align=\"center\" | 86% of maximum\n| align=\"center\" | 58 seconds\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 3\n| align=\"center\" | 984\n| align=\"center\" | 16% of damage done\n| align=\"center\" | 84% of maximum\n| align=\"center\" | 56 seconds\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 4\n| align=\"center\" | 1,493\n| align=\"center\" | 18% of damage done\n| align=\"center\" | 82% of maximum\n| align=\"center\" | 54 seconds\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 5\n| align=\"center\" | 2,063\n| align=\"center\" | 20% of damage done\n| align=\"center\" | 80% of maximum\n| align=\"center\" | 52 seconds\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 6\n| align=\"center\" | 2,688\n| align=\"center\" | 22% of damage done\n| align=\"center\" | 78% of maximum\n| align=\"center\" | 50 seconds\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 7\n| align=\"center\" | 3,361\n| align=\"center\" | 24% of damage done\n| align=\"center\" | 76% of maximum\n| align=\"center\" | 48 seconds\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 8\n| align=\"center\" | 4,079\n| align=\"center\" | 26% of damage done\n| align=\"center\" | 74% of maximum\n| align=\"center\" | 46 seconds\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 9\n| align=\"center\" | 4,838\n| align=\"center\" | 28% of damage done\n| align=\"center\" | 72% of maximum\n| align=\"center\" | 44 seconds\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 10\n| align=\"center\" | 5,637\n| align=\"center\" | 30% of damage done\n| align=\"center\" | 70% of maximum\n| align=\"center\" | 42 seconds\n|}\n\n====Transcendence====\n'''Relic Type:''' Active\n\n'''Cooldown:''' 100 seconds\n\n'''Duration:''' 10 seconds\n\nWhen this Relic is has been [[Meta_Talismans#Activatable_Relics|activated]], your character will go into a trance, be covered in a blue aura, and be able to cast hostile spells(such as Lightning) in a frenzy for up to 10 seconds. This is similar to how the Quicksilver Relic works where instead of increasing the attack speed, this Relic will increase the casting speed! The casting time for a spell becomes 1/(Relic Level +1) of its original casting time, so for Level 1 your casting time is 1/2 or a 50% increase in casting speed and at Level 9 it would be 1/10 or a 90% increase. The secondary effect for the speed up in casting is the reduce cost in mana so that these spells which each Level of this relic provides aa Relic Level amount reduction in the spells cost. A level 10 relic would make a lightning strike 1 mana for instance. If you enter into PVP(Player vs Player) combat during this trance, the Relic will deactivate. You cannot target a player while the under the the effects of Transcendence. Experience is gained through damage done while under the effects of Transcendence.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! align=\"center\" | '''Level'''\n! align=\"center\" | '''Experience Required'''\n! align=\"center\" | '''New Casting Time'''\n! align=\"center\" | '''Casting Speed Increase'''\n! align=\"center\" | '''Mana Cost Reduction'''\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 1\n| align=\"center\" | 600\n| align=\"center\" | 50% of the original casting time\n| align=\"center\" | 50% Faster than normal\n| align=\"center\" | 1 mana\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 2\n| align=\"center\" | 1,639\n| align=\"center\" | 33% of the original casting time\n| align=\"center\" | 66% Faster than normal\n| align=\"center\" | 2 mana\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 3\n| align=\"center\" | 2,951\n| align=\"center\" | 25% of the original casting time\n| align=\"center\" | 75% Faster than normal\n| align=\"center\" | 3 mana\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 4\n| align=\"center\" | 4,479\n| align=\"center\" | 20% of the original casting time\n| align=\"center\" | 80% Faster than normal\n| align=\"center\" | 4 mana\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 5\n| align=\"center\" | 6,190\n| align=\"center\" | 17% of the original casting time\n| align=\"center\" | 83% Faster than normal\n| align=\"center\" | 5 mana\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 6\n| align=\"center\" | 8,063\n| align=\"center\" | 14% of the original casting time\n| align=\"center\" | 86% Faster than normal\n| align=\"center\" | 6 mana\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 7\n| align=\"center\" | 10,082\n| align=\"center\" | 13% of the original casting time\n| align=\"center\" | 87% Faster than normal\n| align=\"center\" | 7 mana\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 8\n| align=\"center\" | 12,236\n| align=\"center\" | 12% of the original casting time\n| align=\"center\" | 88% Faster than normal\n| align=\"center\" | 8 mana\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 9\n| align=\"center\" | 14,515\n| align=\"center\" | 10% of the original casting time\n| align=\"center\" | 90% Faster than normal\n| align=\"center\" | 9 mana\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 10\n| align=\"center\" | 16,910\n| align=\"center\" | 9% of the original casting time\n| align=\"center\" | 91% Faster than normal\n| align=\"center\" | 10 mana\n|}\n\n====Vivify====\n'''Relic Type:''' Active\n\n'''Cooldown:''' 30 seconds\n\n'''Duration:''' 8 minutes\n\nThis [[Meta_Talismans#Activatable_Relics|Activatable Relic]] is used to buff a summoned creature that you can control(such as a Daemon or Elemental but not Energy Vortexes or Bladed Spirits). The cooldown for this relic is 30 seconds. The ability has a Channeling time, which means the summoned creature needs to stay within 3 tiles of the targeted location that the spell began before the Vivify buff can be applied. If the target stays within the location until the end of the animation, then the following buffs will be applied:\n* Increase in Skills and Stats equal to Relic level * 6.66% .\n* Armor increased by Relic Level * 4.44%.\n* Duration that the summon will stay active is increased to 8 minutes.\n* The chance to dispel a summoned creature will be reduced, which will be the Normal Dispel Chance / (Relic Level + 1). Higher Levels means lower chances to dispel this Vivified Target.\n* Vivified Targets will be dyed a random Metallic color, unless your Meta Talisman has been dyed. Dyed Meta Talismans will apply their colors to Vivified Targets.\n* If the target is already Vivified, the targets Health, Mana, and Stamina will be restored by a set amount, repeatedly for a short duration. This also applies to non-Vivified summons!\n\nNotes:\n* The Target will receive a buff relative to the Level of the Relic, the higher the level, the better the buffs.\n* Only while the Target is Vivified will Relic XP be granted after killing a sufficiently difficult monster of which there will need to be a minimum amount of 1 damage done by that summoned creature.\n* Vivify XP gains will also include the damage from the Vivify Owner. As long as the Vivify Summon has dealt 1 damage to a target, the Vivify XP gained will be calculated as if all damage from the Vivify Owner is from the Vivify Summon.\n* If you enter into PVP(Player vs Player) combat, the Vivify will deactivate.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! align=\"center\" | '''Level'''\n! align=\"center\" | '''Experience Required'''\n! align=\"center\" | '''Bonus Skills and Stats'''\n! align=\"center\" | '''Bonus Armor'''\n! align=\"center\" | '''Dispel Chance Reduction'''\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 1\n| align=\"center\" | 4500\n| align=\"center\" | 6.66%\n| align=\"center\" | 4.44%\n| align=\"center\" | Normal Dispel Chance / 2\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 2\n| align=\"center\" | 12,294\n| align=\"center\" | 13.32%\n| align=\"center\" | 8.88%\n| align=\"center\" | Normal Dispel Chance / 3\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 3\n| align=\"center\" | 22,133\n| align=\"center\" | 19.98%\n| align=\"center\" | 13.32%\n| align=\"center\" | Normal Dispel Chance / 4\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 4\n| align=\"center\" | 33,589\n| align=\"center\" | 26.64%\n| align=\"center\" | 17.76%\n| align=\"center\" | Normal Dispel Chance / 5\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 5\n| align=\"center\" | 46,421\n| align=\"center\" | 33.3%\n| align=\"center\" | 22.2%\n| align=\"center\" | Normal Dispel Chance / 6\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 6\n| align=\"center\" | 60,469\n| align=\"center\" | 39.96%\n| align=\"center\" | 26.64%\n| align=\"center\" | Normal Dispel Chance / 7\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 7\n| align=\"center\" | 75,614\n| align=\"center\" | 46.62%\n| align=\"center\" | 31.08%\n| align=\"center\" | Normal Dispel Chance / 8\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 8\n| align=\"center\" | 91,768\n| align=\"center\" | 53.28%\n| align=\"center\" | 35.52%\n| align=\"center\" | Normal Dispel Chance / 9\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 9\n| align=\"center\" | 108,859\n| align=\"center\" | 59.94%\n| align=\"center\" | 39.96%\n| align=\"center\" | Normal Dispel Chance / 10\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 10\n| align=\"center\" | 126,827\n| align=\"center\" | 66.6%\n| align=\"center\" | 44.4%\n| align=\"center\" | Normal Dispel Chance / 11\n|}\n\n=== Tips, Tricks and Templates ===\n\nWhen completing the initial quest line, you may want to consider switching your character to a warrior or tank mage to complete killing the 100 evil creatures. Alternatively, make use of slayer spell books to kill the evil creatures as a pure mage but note that this can be somewhat laborious as you cannot use summons to help you.\n\nThe Meta Mage is arguably the most laborious of all the talisman. You should therefore make best use of all things that improve levelling efficiency:\n* Don't wear any or very minimal armor. Leather bought from NPCs with slayer properties applied will provide the best balance for damage mitigation and experience gains.\n* Level up Spirit Speak to 100 for spell cost reduction. \n* Use Slayer Spell books to increase spell damage and therefore experience gains ''but'' be aware that at higher levels when you start dishing out some serious damage and killing monsters quickly, you may be better off using weaker spells or dropping the slayer spellbook to eek out the maximum possible experience per monsters. Note: Unlike normal spellbooks, crafted slayer spell can be stolen.\n* Apply the Shadow Disciple relic first as it provides both increased damage and returns mana.\n* Kill the biggest creatures you can find. If you are struggling, ask a friendly tamer or bard if you can follow them around and cast spells on the creatures they are killing.\n\nCommon templates are:\n* Magery, Evaluating Intelligence, Healing, Anatomy, Spirit Speak, Meditation, Resisting Spells - This provides defensive wresting through Evaluating Intelligence and Anatomy, allows bandages to be used to heal and therefore save mana and Spirit Speak to conserve mana. Resisting Spells is useful to mitigate interruptions from poisons and paralyze spells.\n* Magery, Evaluating Intelligence, Spirit Speak, Wrestling, Inscription, Meditation, Resisting Spells - Inscription lets you craft your own slayer spell books and number of spells that can be reflected with the Magic Reflection spell.\n\n==Phylactery of Resilience==\n[[File:defencetali.png|right]]\n\nThe Phylactery of Resilience, also known as the Defense Talisman, offers increased survivability in combat. There are 5 relics available to reduce incoming damage from fire breath and poison damage, as well as, provide retaliation attacks such as reflected damage, stuns, and even the ability to steal hit points from nearby creatures. [[Meta_Talismans#Relic_Qualities|Flawed Talisman Relics]] can be found as possible drops from [[Dungeon_Bosses|Dungeon Bosses]] while [[Meta_Talismans#Relic_Qualities|Crumbling Talisman Relics]] can be found on [[Monster_of_the_Week|Monster of the Week mobs]], [[Idol_of_Forbidden_Magic#Graveyards|World Objectives (such as necromancer cemetery mobs)]], [[Treasure_Map|Treasure Maps]], [[Message_in_a_Bottle|Messages in a Bottle]], [[Whirlpool|Whirlpools]] and [[Paragons|Paragon Chests]].\n\n===Benefits===\n====Reduced Damage====\nThe Phylactery of Resilience, informally known as the Defence Talisman, offers increased protection from melee and magical damage from creatures. There are ten levels of the talisman and on average you gain 5% damage reduction per level.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! align=\"center\" | '''Level'''\n! align=\"center\" | '''Bonus Protection'''\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 1\n| align=\"center\" | 5%\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 2\n| align=\"center\" | 10%\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 3\n| align=\"center\" | 15%\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 4\n| align=\"center\" | 20%\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 5\n| align=\"center\" | 25%\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 6\n| align=\"center\" | 30%\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 7\n| align=\"center\" | 35%\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 8\n| align=\"center\" | 40%\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 9\n| align=\"center\" | 45%\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 10\n| align=\"center\" | 50%\n|}\n\n===Leveling===\nTalisman experience is gained through damage that gets converted into experience. The levels are calculated with a \"Base Value\" and a \"Per Level Power\" in the formula: \"Base Value\" * (Level ^ \"Per Level Power\"). The Base Value for the talisman is 10000 and the Per Level Power is a factor of 1.3. The following table explains the experience required to gain Talisman Levels:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! align=\"center\" | '''Level'''\n! align=\"center\" | '''Experience Required'''\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 1\n| align=\"center\" | 10,000\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 2\n| align=\"center\" | 24,623\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 3\n| align=\"center\" | 41,712\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 4\n| align=\"center\" | 60,629\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 5\n| align=\"center\" | 81,033\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 6\n| align=\"center\" | 102,706\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 7\n| align=\"center\" | 125,495\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 8\n| align=\"center\" | 149,285\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 9\n| align=\"center\" | 173,986\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 10\n| align=\"center\" | 199,526\n|}\n\n====Penalties====\nThe amount you gain is penalized by wearing too little armor. To ensure maximum experience gains, keep your armor at or above 80. The amount of experience gained is also affected by distance from the creature. The penalty is 20% for each tile beyond 1.5. Stay close, be well armored and crush those evil creatures!\n\n===Arms Lore===\nThe wielder of an active Phylactery of Resilience, Totem of the Berserker, or Artifact of the Marksman with 100 Arms Lore and 100 Weapon Skill receives an increased Minimum Hit Chance. You will only get this increase if you are wielding a weapon relevant to your chosen Weapon Skill. For example, against a creature with 100 wrestling, a normal warrior with 100 Swordsmanship wielding a katana has a 50% chance to hit the creature. With the talisman and 100 Arms Lore, this increases to ~63%. Note, however, that this does not raise your Hit Chance by a flat amount it just raises it to ~63% if you are currently below that. If you intend to kill only lowly ogres and ettins, you can probably skip Arms Lore. If however you want to take on bigger monsters such as with 100 or greater wrestling, such as dungeon bosses, then consider fitting this into your template.\n\n===Relics===\nPhylactery of Resilience has 5 relics available to reduce incoming damage from fire breath and poison damage, as well as, provide retaliation attacks such as reflected damage, stuns, and even the ability to steal hit points from nearby creatures. [[Meta_Talismans#Relic_Qualities|Flawed Talisman Relics]] can be found as possible drops from [[Dungeon_Bosses|Dungeon Bosses]] while [[Meta_Talismans#Relic_Qualities|Crumbling Talisman Relics]] can be found on [[Monster_of_the_Week|Monster of the Week mobs]], [[Idol_of_Forbidden_Magic#Graveyards|World Objectives (such as necromancer cemetery mobs)]], [[Treasure_Map|Treasure Maps]], [[Message_in_a_Bottle|Messages in a Bottle]], [[Whirlpool|Whirlpools]] and [[Paragons|Paragon Chests]].\n\n====Leech====\n'''Relic Type:''' Passive\n\n'''Cooldown:''' ???\n\n'''Proc Chance:''' ???\n\nLeech provides the ability for the player to sap small amounts of health from nearby creatures when damaged. The amount per creature is capped at the skill level and is a random value from 1 to relic level. The chance to activate and cool down are affected by gaining levels.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! align=\"center\" | '''Level'''\n! align=\"center\" | '''Experience Required'''\n! align=\"center\" | '''Range of Health Sapped'''\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 1\n| align=\"center\" | 200\n| align=\"center\" | 1\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 2\n| align=\"center\" | 546\n| align=\"center\" | 1-2\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 3\n| align=\"center\" | 984\n| align=\"center\" | 1-3\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 4\n| align=\"center\" | 1,493\n| align=\"center\" | 1-4\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 5\n| align=\"center\" | 2,063\n| align=\"center\" | 1-5\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 6\n| align=\"center\" | 2,688\n| align=\"center\" | 1-6\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 7\n| align=\"center\" | 3,361\n| align=\"center\" | 1-7\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 8\n| align=\"center\" | 4,079\n| align=\"center\" | 1-8\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 9\n| align=\"center\" | 4,838\n| align=\"center\" | 1-9\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 10\n| align=\"center\" | 5,637\n| align=\"center\" | 1-10\n|}\n\n====Quench====\n'''Relic Type:''' Passive\n\n'''Proc Chance:''' ???\n\nQuench provides a chance to resist fire breath. Once triggered it provides protection against fire breath for a period of time determined by the relic level. The duration lasts for (Level * 5) seconds.

When it activates, it returns 2x base damage to the creature. There is a 25% chance to turn an opponent's attack onto him. At Level 1 it starts with a 30 second cooldown. With each level the cooldown reduces by 1 second, resulting in a 20 second cooldown at Level 10.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! align=\"center\" | '''Level'''\n! align=\"center\" | '''Experience Required'''\n! align=\"center\" | '''Cooldown'''\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 1\n| align=\"center\" | 200\n| align=\"center\" | 29 seconds\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 2\n| align=\"center\" | 546\n| align=\"center\" | 28 seconds\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 3\n| align=\"center\" | 984\n| align=\"center\" | 27 seconds\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 4\n| align=\"center\" | 1,493\n| align=\"center\" | 26 seconds\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 5\n| align=\"center\" | 2,063\n| align=\"center\" | 25 seconds\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 6\n| align=\"center\" | 2,688\n| align=\"center\" | 24 seconds\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 7\n| align=\"center\" | 3,361\n| align=\"center\" | 23 seconds\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 8\n| align=\"center\" | 4,079\n| align=\"center\" | 22 seconds\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 9\n| align=\"center\" | 4,838\n| align=\"center\" | 21 seconds\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 10\n| align=\"center\" | 5,637\n| align=\"center\" | 20 seconds\n|}\n\n====Remedy====\n'''Relic Type:''' Passive\n\n'''Proc Chance:''' 25%\n\nRemedy provides a chance to resist poison from a melee hit, such as a scorpion's sting, for a period of time determined by the relic level.

While you may need to pay slightly less attention to your health bar than the other talismans, you can't completely disengage. Keep the following things in mind:\n* Keep your armor at or above 80 at all times. Regularly check armor damage as you will be taking some big blows from the level of creature you will be fighting. A character with blacksmith will come in handy for repairs or you will need to stock up on repair deeds.\n* Strongly consider including [[Parrying]] in your template to protect your armor and provide extra damage mitigation. This is particularly useful at lower levels.\n* Consider using a Swamp Dragon for even more damage mitigation.\n* If you can afford it, consider adding some [[Slayer_Armor|slayer properties]] to your armor.\n* Quench and Remedy are best applied early on as they provide excellent protection and can take quite some time to level up.\n\nA classic template is:\n* Weapon Skill, Parrying, Healing, Anatomy, Resisting Spells, Tactics and either:\n** Magery for overall utility. The ability to use Reactive Armor, Recall, Cure, Reflect, and Teleport are all very useful.\n** Arms Lore to increase your hit chance (Using runebooks loaded with recalls to travel around).\n\n==Totem of the Berserker==\n[[File:zerkertali.png|right]]\n\nThe Totem of the Berserker, also known as the Berserker or Zerk Talisman, provides increase offensive bonuses in combat. While typically used with melee weapons, this Damage Bonus can be applied to Archery, however only up to 2 tiles away, so it is recommended to use [[Meta_Talismans#Artifact_of_the_Marksman|Artifact of the Marksman]] to get the most out of ranged combat!\n\n===Benefits===\n====Increased Damage====\nTotem of the Berserker provides a damage bonus of 5% per level.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! align=\"center\" | '''Level'''\n! align=\"center\" | '''Bonus Damage'''\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 1\n| align=\"center\" | 5%\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 2\n| align=\"center\" | 10%\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 3\n| align=\"center\" | 15%\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 4\n| align=\"center\" | 20%\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 5\n| align=\"center\" | 25%\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 6\n| align=\"center\" | 30%\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 7\n| align=\"center\" | 35%\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 8\n| align=\"center\" | 40%\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 9\n| align=\"center\" | 45%\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 10\n| align=\"center\" | 50%\n|}\n\n===Leveling===\nTalisman experience is gained through damage that gets converted into experience. The levels are calculated with a \"Base Value\" and a \"Per Level Power\" in the formula: \"Base Value\" * (Level ^ \"Per Level Power\"). The Base Value for the talisman is 10000 and the Per Level Power is a factor of 1.3. The following table explains the experience required to gain Talisman Levels:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! align=\"center\" | '''Level'''\n! align=\"center\" | '''Experience Required'''\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 1\n| align=\"center\" | 10,000\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 2\n| align=\"center\" | 24,623\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 3\n| align=\"center\" | 41,712\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 4\n| align=\"center\" | 60,629\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 5\n| align=\"center\" | 81,033\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 6\n| align=\"center\" | 102,706\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 7\n| align=\"center\" | 125,495\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 8\n| align=\"center\" | 149,285\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 9\n| align=\"center\" | 173,986\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 10\n| align=\"center\" | 199,526\n|}\n\n====Penalties====\nThe more armor you wear, the less experience you gain for damaging creatures at a rate of 1% per AR. As with the Defense Talisman, there is a distance penalty on experience gained of 20% per tile beyond 1.5 tiles.\n\n===Arms Lore===\nThe wielder of an active Phylactery of Resilience, Totem of the Berserker, or Artifact of the Marksman with 100 Arms Lore and 100 Weapon Skill receives an increased Minimum Hit Chance. You will only get this increase if you are wielding a weapon relevant to your chosen Weapon Skill. For example, against a creature with 100 wrestling, a normal warrior with 100 Swordsmanship wielding a katana has a 50% chance to hit the creature. With the talisman and 100 Arms Lore, this increases to ~63%. Note, however, that this does not raise your Hit Chance by a flat amount it just raises it to ~63% if you are currently below that. If you intend to kill only lowly ogres and ettins, you can probably skip Arms Lore. If however you want to take on bigger monsters such as with 100 or greater wrestling, such as dungeon bosses, then consider fitting this into your template.\n\n===Relics===\nTotem of the Berserker has 5 relics available to increase offensive bonuses in combat. [[Meta_Talismans#Relic_Qualities|Flawed Talisman Relics]] can be found as possible drops from [[Dungeon_Bosses|Dungeon Bosses]] while [[Meta_Talismans#Relic_Qualities|Crumbling Talisman Relics]] can be found on [[Monster_of_the_Week|Monster of the Week mobs]], [[Idol_of_Forbidden_Magic#Graveyards|World Objectives (such as necromancer cemetery mobs)]], [[Treasure_Map|Treasure Maps]], [[Message_in_a_Bottle|Messages in a Bottle]], [[Whirlpool|Whirlpools]] and [[Paragons|Paragon Chests]].\n\n====Double Strike====\n'''Relic Type:''' Passive\n\nOn a successful swing this relic may activate which the berserker will double swing on the creature. It does an instant swing following a normal swing provided you are within 5 tiles and starts with a 25% chance to activate with a 30 second cooldown. The damage is recalculated for the second strike so the damage number will almost certainly differ. Leveling this ability lowers the cooldown and increases the chance of activation.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! align=\"center\" | '''Level'''\n! align=\"center\" | '''Experience Required'''\n! align=\"center\" | '''Proc Chance'''\n! align=\"center\" | '''Cooldown'''\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 1\n| align=\"center\" | 200\n| align=\"center\" | 25%\n| align=\"center\" | 30 seconds\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 2\n| align=\"center\" | 546\n| align=\"center\" | ???\n| align=\"center\" | 28 seconds\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 3\n| align=\"center\" | 984\n| align=\"center\" | ???\n| align=\"center\" | 27 seconds\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 4\n| align=\"center\" | 1,493\n| align=\"center\" | ???\n| align=\"center\" | 26 seconds\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 5\n| align=\"center\" | 2,063\n| align=\"center\" | ???\n| align=\"center\" | 25 seconds\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 6\n| align=\"center\" | 2,688\n| align=\"center\" | ???\n| align=\"center\" | 24 seconds\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 7\n| align=\"center\" | 3,361\n| align=\"center\" | ???\n| align=\"center\" | 23 seconds\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 8\n| align=\"center\" | 4,079\n| align=\"center\" | ???\n| align=\"center\" | 22 seconds\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 9\n| align=\"center\" | 4,838\n| align=\"center\" | ???\n| align=\"center\" | 21 seconds\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 10\n| align=\"center\" | 5,637\n| align=\"center\" | ???\n| align=\"center\" | 20 seconds\n|}\n\n====Infected Wounds====\n'''Relic Type:''' Passive\n\n'''Proc Chance:''' ???\n\nWhen this relic activates on a hit, the target becomes infected with a special debuff that increases the damage that the target takes from this Relic. When a target has the Infected Wounds debuff active, it will begin to take damage every 0.5 seconds for 3 seconds which the damage will increase as the target loses hit points. The damage calculation per 0.5 seconds is based on Relic Level and the current Missing Hit Points, which is the Highest of the Lowest value of either 10% of the targets Missing Health or the Infected Wounds Relic Level * 4 in damage. AKA Damage Calculation = Larger of (Smaller of ( 10% of missing health, or Level * 4 dmg), Level)\n\n[[File:Totem_Of_The_Berserker_Infected_Wounds_Estimated_Damage_Table.PNG|500px]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! align=\"center\" | '''Level'''\n! align=\"center\" | '''Experience Required'''\n! align=\"center\" | '''Cooldown'''\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 1\n| align=\"center\" | 300\n| align=\"center\" | 60 seconds\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 2\n| align=\"center\" | 820\n| align=\"center\" | 57 seconds\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 3\n| align=\"center\" | 1,476\n| align=\"center\" | 55 seconds\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 4\n| align=\"center\" | 2,239\n| align=\"center\" | 53 seconds\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 5\n| align=\"center\" | 3,095\n| align=\"center\" | 51 seconds\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 6\n| align=\"center\" | 4,031\n| align=\"center\" | 49 seconds\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 7\n| align=\"center\" | 5,041\n| align=\"center\" | 47 seconds\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 8\n| align=\"center\" | 6,118\n| align=\"center\" | 45 seconds\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 9\n| align=\"center\" | 7,257\n| align=\"center\" | 43 seconds\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 10\n| align=\"center\" | 8,455\n| align=\"center\" | 41 seconds\n|}\n\n====Phase Shift====\n'''Relic Type:''' Passive\n\n'''Proc Chance:''' 100%\n\nUpon attacking a creature at range the berserker teleport attacks to the targeted creature. The cooldown starts at 60 seconds but has a guaranteed activation on attack. The target must reside on a tile that can be walked on and more than 7 tiles away. Originally, the ability received an additional phase jump for every other level gained for a maximum of 3 and each shift consumes 10 stamina but this was modified as it was teleporting players into some dangerous situations! Phase Shift now teleports to a single target. Each level lowers the cooldown. 100 [[Hiding]] and [[Stealth]] will provide 50% bonus damage when phase shifting while hidden.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! align=\"center\" | '''Level'''\n! align=\"center\" | '''Experience Required'''\n! align=\"center\" | '''GM Hiding and Stealth Bonus Damage while Hidden'''\n! align=\"center\" | '''Cooldown'''\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 1\n| align=\"center\" | 200\n| align=\"center\" | 50%\n| align=\"center\" | 60 seconds\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 2\n| align=\"center\" | 546\n| align=\"center\" | 50%\n| align=\"center\" | 56 seconds\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 3\n| align=\"center\" | 984\n| align=\"center\" | 50%\n| align=\"center\" | 52 seconds\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 4\n| align=\"center\" | 1,493\n| align=\"center\" | 50%\n| align=\"center\" | 48 seconds\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 5\n| align=\"center\" | 2,063\n| align=\"center\" | 50%\n| align=\"center\" | 44 seconds\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 6\n| align=\"center\" | 2,688\n| align=\"center\" | 50%\n| align=\"center\" | 40 seconds\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 7\n| align=\"center\" | 3,361\n| align=\"center\" | 50%\n| align=\"center\" | 36 seconds\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 8\n| align=\"center\" | 4,079\n| align=\"center\" | 50%\n| align=\"center\" | 32 seconds\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 9\n| align=\"center\" | 4,838\n| align=\"center\" | 50%\n| align=\"center\" | 28 seconds\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 10\n| align=\"center\" | 5,637\n| align=\"center\" | 50%\n| align=\"center\" | 24 seconds\n|}\n\n====Primal Scream====\n'''Relic Type:''' Active\n\n'''Cooldown:''' 30 seconds\n\n'''Duration:''' 5 seconds\n\nYou can Activate a scream every 30 seconds that will provide yourself with a buff to both your Dexterity and Stamina of the Primal Scream Relic Level times 40 for a total of 5 seconds.

As long as you follow these basic rules, you should be able to quickly progress through the levels:\n\n* Like the Meta Mage and in keeping with your title, a berserker should wear little or no armor for maximum gains. Leather bought from NPCs with [[Slayer_Armor|slayer properties]] applied will provide the best balance for damage mitigation and experience gains.\n* Unlike the Meta Mage, you do not have the luxury of standing at range and if you cannot afford a full set of slayer armor, you may need to resort to jousting.\n* As you may need to joust, Arms Lore is very useful for efficient levelling to provide a greater chance for a successful hit.\n* Definitely do not use a shield or [[Parry]], your armor will be too high reducing your experience gains.\n* Use slayer weapons to ensure you get maximum damage.\n* Primal Scream is a good choice for a first relic to start out with, it gives a great damage boost which levels the talisman faster and is an [[Meta_Talismans#Activatable_Relics|Activatable Relic]] so there are no wasted procs, plus it's fun!\n* Use a Swamp Dragon to reduce damage taken.\n\nThere are many different ways to play a Zerker but here are a few suggestions to get you started:\n\n* Weapon Skill, Tactics, Anatomy, Healing, Resist, Arms Lore and either:\n** Magery for overall utility. The ability to use Reactive Armor, Recall, Cure, Reflect, and Teleport are all very useful\n** Lumberjacking for even more damage if you opt for Swordsmanship.\n** Hiding for a quick escape to avoid really nasty creatures (and players).\n\n== Shadow of the Rogue ==\n[[File:zerkertali.png|right]]\n\nThe Shadow Of The Rogue talisman is a take on the classic RPG rogue class. It includes four relics and an entirely new relic leveling concept. The talisman itself levels in the same manner of the existing talismans. The talisman and relics are available on the gold sink vendor for 1,000,000 gp for the talisman and 4,000,000 gp for each relic. This talisman does not require the completion the talisman quest in order to begin using these benefits or applying relics.\n\n===Benefits===\n====Amplified Damage====\n* Knives get a Level * 20% bonus to knife weapons (i.e. 200% at Level 10)\n* Crossbows get a Level * 13% (i.e. 130% bonus at Level 10)\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! align=\"center\" | '''Level'''\n! align=\"center\" | '''Knife Bonus Damage'''\n! align=\"center\" | '''Crossbow Bonus Damage'''\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 1\n| align=\"center\" | 20%\n| align=\"center\" | 13%\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 2\n| align=\"center\" | 40%\n| align=\"center\" | 26%\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 3\n| align=\"center\" | 60%\n| align=\"center\" | 39%\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 4\n| align=\"center\" | 80%\n| align=\"center\" | 52%\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 5\n| align=\"center\" | 100%\n| align=\"center\" | 65%\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 6\n| align=\"center\" | 120%\n| align=\"center\" | 78%\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 7\n| align=\"center\" | 140%\n| align=\"center\" | 91%\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 8\n| align=\"center\" | 160%\n| align=\"center\" | 104%\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 9\n| align=\"center\" | 180%\n| align=\"center\" | 117%\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 10\n| align=\"center\" | 200%\n| align=\"center\" | 130%\n|}\n\n====Running Stealth====\nThe wearer gains the ability to run while stealth to a distance of 5 * Level tiles (i.e. 50 tiles at Level 10)\n\n===Updates===\nThere were some past changes to the Shadow of the Rogue Talisman as indicated in the following patch notes:\n* [https://www.uoforum.com/threads/server-update-8-7-3-0-tons-of-talisman-relic-updates-rogue-talisman-provisional-update-and-more.110169/ Server update 8.7.3.0 - Tons of Talisman Relic updates, Rogue Talisman Provisional update, and more.]\n\nAdditional new updates have been made to the Rogue Talisman, including the addition of three new relics:\n* [https://www.uoforum.com/threads/8-8-4-1-rogue-talisman-changes-and-additions-lots-of-bug-fixes.110323/#post-792921/ Server update 8.8.4.1 - Rogue Talisman changes and additions, lots of bug fixes!]\n\n====Summary====\n* In preparation for some incoming Shadow of the Rogue Talisman changes, we are moving away from the \"Kill for XP\" system to a more permanent XP system that functions like the rest of the Meta Talismans.\n* In the meantime, until April 15th levelling will be based on both kills or levels but you will gain permanent XP.\n* After the provisional period your levels will be based on permanent XP and this will function like a regular talisman.\n* Experience requirements to level up all Talismans and Relics is now calculated with a \"Base Value\" and a \"Per Level Power\" in the formula: \"Base Value\" * (Level ^ \"Per Level Power\").\n\n===Leveling===\nThe leveling system currently going through a transition until April 15th where levels are based on kills for levels but you will also gain permanent experience.\n\n====Kill for EXP Method====\nThe relic leveling mechanic is designed to make the leveling process much less cumbersome and yet reward those that dedicate themselves to using this talisman.\n\nThe talisman relics track kills of all creatures that have over 100 max hit points. The relic levels of the talisman are based on the number of kills recorded. 20 kills for level 2 relics, 50 kills for level 3 relics, 90 kills for level 4 relics, 150 for 5, 300 for 6, etc. You will have level 10 relics with 700 stored kills. Every 24 hours 25 kills will decay from the total kill count. You can build up to 800 kills, but the total will be capped at that number. This will allow you talisman 4 days of not being used before it reverts down to level 9 relics on 5th day.\n\n====Permanent Experience Method====\nTalisman experience is gained through damage that gets converted into experience. The levels are calculated with a \"Base Value\" and a \"Per Level Power\" in the formula: \"Base Value\" * (Level ^ \"Per Level Power\"). The Base Value for the talisman is 10000 and the Per Level Power is a factor of 1.3. The following table explains the experience required to gain Talisman Levels:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! align=\"center\" | '''Level'''\n! align=\"center\" | '''Experience Required'''\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 1\n| align=\"center\" | 10,000\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 2\n| align=\"center\" | 24,623\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 3\n| align=\"center\" | 41,712\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 4\n| align=\"center\" | 60,629\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 5\n| align=\"center\" | 81,033\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 6\n| align=\"center\" | 102,706\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 7\n| align=\"center\" | 125,495\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 8\n| align=\"center\" | 149,285\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 9\n| align=\"center\" | 173,986\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 10\n| align=\"center\" | 199,526\n|}\n\n====Penalties====\nThe more armor you wear, the less experience you gain for damaging creatures at a rate of 1% per AR. As with the Defense Talisman, there is a distance penalty on experience gained of 20% per tile beyond 1.5 tiles.\n\n=== Arms Lore ===\nArms Lore has the same effect Minimum Hit Chance increase for the Shadow of the Rogue as it does for a Phylactery of Resilience and Berserker Talisman.
