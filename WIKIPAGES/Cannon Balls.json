[[Cannon Balls]] can be crafted with [[Blacksmithing]] individually or by the sack. A minimum of 65.0 [[Blacksmithing]] is required to craft [[Cannon Balls]] and can be created in bulk (Sacks) at higher skills.\n\n==Usages==\nTo load the [[Cannon Balls]] into [[Cannons]]. Double click the [[Cannon Balls]] in your inventory and target any single cannon on each side of the ship and wait. You can see how many Cannon Balls each cannon has by single clicking on a cannon.\n\nAfter you've loaded your [[Cannons]] with [[Cannon Balls]], you can then issue the \"Fire Left\" or \"Fire Right\" Ship Commands, this will give you a target reticle, allowing you to aim at an enemy ship, player or creature.\n\nThe Cannons will each fire one time, consuming a single Cannon Balls from each cannon. Note that Cannons are not entirely accurate and can sometimes miss.\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Cannon Balls]]\n*[[Galleons]]\n*[[Ships]]\n*[[Ship Upgrades]]\n*[[Naval Warfare Reborn]]\n*[[Blacksmithing]]"
