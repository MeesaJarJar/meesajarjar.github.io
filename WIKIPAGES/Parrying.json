In usual practice you must equip a Shield in order to parry - Which type doesn't make a difference. If you fail to parry, a shield still offers Armor Rating. Parrying can only be used when holding a shield which results in the restriction of one handed weapons.\n\n==Recommended Leveling==\n:0-50: Buy from NPC\n:50-100: Get attacked by monsters or players while wearing a shield.\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Macing]]\n*[[Swordsmanship]]\n*[[Fencing]]\n\n[[Category:Skills]]"
