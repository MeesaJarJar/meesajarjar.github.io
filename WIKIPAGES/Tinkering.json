It's paired well with any other crafting skill considering you can craft the tools you will be using along the way. Miners can create more pickaxes or blacksmiths can create more hammers for example. Tinkers may also craft jewelry, although, this is considered useless since there is no craftable magic jewelry.\n\nIn the [[Naval Warfare Reborn]] expansion, a few items were added to the [[Tinkering]] to upgrade ships as well as materials to use with ships. \n\nTinkers usually use [[Ingots]] but also can use [[wood]] for some items.\n\n[[Power Scrolls]] and [[Skill Scroll]]s are available for this skill.\n\n==Usage==\nBy double clicking Tinker tools or a Tinkers Kit you get to the [[Tinkering]] menu where you can select the Tools or Items you want to make, view the success chance, ingredients needed, and minimal Tinkering skill to attempt making the item. If you have below the level needed, it will tell you that youâ€™re not skilled enough to try.\n\n==Ingot Types==\nSpecial Ingots can be used when crafting, however you must meet the following minimum skill levels in order to craft with these [[Ingots]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!
