This special area, found in the north of [[Britain]], provides the following benefits to crafters:\n* Adds a 10% bonus chance to craft exceptional items.\n* Reduces resource use by 20%.\n* Gives a chance to create [[Slayer_Types#Slayer_Weapons|Slayer Weapons]] with [[Blacksmithing]], [[Bowcraft]], [[Carpentry]] scales from ~1% at 100 crafting skill, up to ~2% at 120 skill. \n* [[Inscription]] also has a chance to create Slayer Spell Books, however you must be 120 Skill and the slayer chance is 2.5%.\n* When using [[Wood|special wood types]] in the Britain Crafting Area, you will have a chance to create weapons with up to 3 magical properties. The more rare a [[Wood|wood type]] is, the better chance at greater properties!\n* Gives a chance to create \"a bent rod\" with [[Carpentry]] when crafting fishing poles. Similar concept to making [[Slayer_Types#Slayer_Weapons|Slayer Weapons]].\n\n===Notes===\n* This is NOT a safe zone like [[Britain|West Britain]] [[Bank|Bank]]. Be on the look out for thieves and griefers luring spawn from the graveyard! If you are running a crafting macro, consider adding a line to regularly call guards.\n\n==See Also==\n* [[Blacksmithing]]\n* [[Fishing]]\n* [[Lumberjacking]]\n* [[Galleons]]\n* [[Magery]]\n* [[Musicianship]]\n* [[Stone crafter]]\n* [[Tailoring]]\n* [[Tinkering]]\n* [[Wood]]\n\n\n[[Category:Atlas]]\n[[Category:Places of Note‏‎]]\n[[Category:Crafting]]\n[[Category:Skills]]"
