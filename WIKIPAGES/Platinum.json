It used to be found from the following:\n*[[Capture The Flag]]\n*[[Invasions]]\n*[[Champion Spawns]]\n*[[Paragon Chests]]\n*[[Random Dungeon Adventure]]\n\nPlatinum was however removed in early 2017. The items that were available from the Platinum Vendor are now available with gold from the Gold Sink Vendor. The following information was taken from the [http://www.uoforum.com/threads/removal-of-platinum-coins.92354/ forum post] detailing the change.\n\n===Reason for Removal===\nPlatinum has not had any real update for a long time here so we have decided the best course of action would be to consolidate the items to the gold sink vendor.\n\nPlatinum coins are being removed from the loot tables. On Friday February 17th the drop of platinum will cease. The platinum vendor will be removed and all items from the platinum vendor will be moved over to the Gold Sink vendor at the exchange rate of 35:1 gold to plat. This means an item that costs 10k plat right now will cost 350k gold when active. \n\n===Exchange Rate===\nAny platinum not spent on the platinum vendor prior to Friday the 17th will NOT be wiped from the shard. You will be able to Exchange that platinum with bankers for the exchange rate of 20:1 gold to plat. You will need a minimum of 50 platinum to successfully exchange the platinum to gold with a banker. \n\nParagon chests along with anything else will no longer drop platinum. They will drop gold at the exchange of 20:1. That means if a paragon chest contained 300 platinum it will now contain 6k gold. \n\nThis is now Live. No platinum will be dropping. The platinum vendor is no longer on the live map. The gold sink vendor now has the items on it available for purchase. \n\n===Conversion to Gold===\nFor those of you that still have platinum coins in order to convert it into gold you must simply drag the platinum coins onto ANY in game NPC banker. The banker will then give you a check which will place inside of your bank. Please make sure your bank has space for items to be placed. You will need a minimum of 50 platinum to successfully exchange the platinum to gold with a banker. \n\nAgain, ANY NPC Banker will accept the platinum. I highly suggest you choose to do it at a bank with a low population as you will be drag dropping the platinum onto the NPC. No platinum coins will be replaced for mistakes made during the process of dragging and dropping.\n\n== Platinum Vendor Merchandise ==\n{| cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" width=\"50%\"\n! style=\"background-color:#000; color:#FFFFFF;\" | Item\n! style=\"background-color:#000; color:#FFFFFF;\" | Description\n! style=\"background-color:#000; color:#FFFFFF;\" | Old Platinum Cost\n! style=\"background-color:#000; color:#FFFFFF;\" | New Gold Cost\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[File:Phoenix_gorget.png|Phoenix Gorget]]<br>Phoenix Gorget\n|Blessed studded gorget of the phoenix.\n|5,000\n|175,000\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[File:Phoenix_gloves.png|Phoenix Gloves]]<br>Phoenix Gloves\n|Blessed ringmail gloves of the phoenix.\n|5,000\n|175,000\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[File:Phoenix_legs.png|Phoenix Legs]]<br>Phoenix Legs\n|Blessed ringmail leggings of the phoenix.\n|7,500\n|262,500\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[File:Phoenix_chest.png|Phoenix Chest]]<br>Phoenix Chest\n|Blessed ringmail tunic of the phoenix.\n|7,500\n|262,500\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[File:Phoenix_arms.png|Phoenix Arms]]<br>Phoenix Arms\n|Blessed ringmail sleeves of the phoenix.\n|5,000\n|175,00\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[File:Phoenix_helm.png|Phoenix Helm]]<br>Phoenix Helm\n|Blessed norse helm of the phoenix.\n|5,500\n|192,500\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[File:Deed.png|Mailbox]]<br>Mailbox East Addon Deed\n|Blessed.
