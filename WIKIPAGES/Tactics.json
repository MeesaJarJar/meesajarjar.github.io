Some weapons will add to the tactics attribute giving between 5 and 25 extra points depending on the item properties. It is also coupled well with [[Anatomy]] for even more damage, It works the same way [[Magery]] works with [[Evaluate Intelligence]]. Warriors templates with a weapons skill will do significantly less damage without [[Tactics]] on the following skills:\n\n*[[Swordsmanship]]\n*[[Fencing]]\n*[[Macing]]\n*[[Archery]]\n\n==Usage==\nTactics is a passive damage boost to weapons, meaning you do not need to activate it or use it. \n\n==Recommended Leveling==\n:Simply attacking creatures or players will increase tactics.\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Swordsmanship]]\n*[[Fencing]]\n*[[Macing]]\n*[[Archery]]\n*[[Anatomy]]\n\n[[Category:Skills]]"
