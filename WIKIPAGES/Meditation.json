[[Meditation]] works passively to regain [[Mana]] but can also be used to invoke the skill directly, increasing [[Mana]] regeneration even more. Meditation is often used in conjunction with the [[Magery]] skill but [[Mana]] is required for [[Inscription]] when making scrolls as well. It is typical for a player to have [[Meditation]] with a [[Magery]] template. \n\nUsing the [[Meditation]] skill is useful when a character has reached low [[Mana]] and can be used during breaks in Player vs Player scenarios as well as pauses in combat with creatures. Any actions performed when [[Meditation|Meditating]] will cancel it's invoked regeneration.\n\nA character receives neither passive nor active [[Meditation]] bonuses while wearing non-medable armor. Warriors who wear plate or chain typically do not regenerate [[Mana]] quickly enough to cast Magery Spells effectively. Mages who want to conserve and regenerate [[Mana]] typically wear Leather Armor.\n\n==Recommended Leveling==\n:0-50: Buy from NPC\n:Simply casting Magery Spells will passively gain [[Meditation]].\n:Invoking the [[Meditation]] skill after casting a series of spells\n:See [[Magery]]\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Magery]]\n*[[Mana]]\n\n[[Category:Skills]]"
