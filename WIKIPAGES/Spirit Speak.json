Usually when a ghost attempts speech, all a live character will see is a series of OoOooOo's, the spirit speak skill allows you to clearly read what they intended to say.  For meta mages, it gives mana recovery in PvM.\n\n==Usage==\n'''Listening to Others'''\n:If you manually activate Spirit Speak and successfully channel your spiritual energy, you will hear what ghosts say instead of OooOOOoOo. \n\n'''Spirit Speak & Idol of the Magi '''\n:When a player has a meta talisman Idol of the Magi AND has GM Spirit Speak, they receive 25% mana recovery from any direct damage spell cast against PvM targets.\n\n==Recommended Leveling==\n:0-100: Activate the skill either by macro or skill button.\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Skills]]\n\n[[Category:Skills]]"
