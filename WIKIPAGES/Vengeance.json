All was peaceful here, until word got out that some of the dead were being intered with their belongings.\n\nThis is when the tomb robbers came.\n\nWhere we stand now is the place of my... defilement... and resting place. They took my life for mere trinkets left for the dead.\n\nI was peaceful once, but now I crave vengeance.\n\nGive this to me and I will reward you dearly. Help me kill 10 grave robbers and then guide me to my family's crypt so that I may rest."
