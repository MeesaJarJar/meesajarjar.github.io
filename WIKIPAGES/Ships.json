            "*": "__TOC__\n== Introduction ==\nShips have been in Ultima Online Forever since it's launch but in the most recent [[Naval Warfare Reborn]] expansion, they have been heavily rehauled and new content was added. Ships can be purchased from Shipwrights and [[Galleons]] can be crafted with the [[Carpentry]] skill. [[Ships]] are used on water to sail across the ocean. They are commonly used by players proficient in [[Fishing]], by Treasure Hunters doing [[Message in a Bottle]], by explorers finding new lands and by those wishing to engage in battles over [[Whirlpool]]s.\n\nShip deeds and Dry-docked ships are blessed. This is due to the very high cost of the boats. This means that upon dying, your Ship will remain in your inventory. They also cannot be controlled by other players without your specific permission. The permissions menu, as well as other useful Ship information and controls can be accessed by double clicking on the \"Tillerman\".\n\n==Old Commands==\n:'''Forward''': Travel Forward.\n:'''Forward''' Left: Travel in a Forward Left direction.\n:'''Forward Right''': Travel in a Forward Right direction.\n:'''Back/Backward''': Travel backwards.\n:'''Right''': Travel to the right without turning the ship.\n:'''Left''': Travel to the left without turning the ship.\n:'''Turn Left''': Turn the ship to the left.\n:'''Turn Right''': Turn the ship to the right.\n:'''Raise Anchor''': Raise the anchor, allowing the ship to begin movement.\n:'''Drop Anchor''': Lower the anchor, to prevent movement commands from activating.\n:'''Turn About''': Flips the nose of the ship around to face the other direction.\n\n==New Commands==\n:'''Embark''': Speaking embark near a vessel your are a captain, officer or deckhand of will cause you to be transported to a random location on the deck. This only works if you are not currently on a ship. The closest vessel to you is always chosen first. This command can also be accessed through the new vessel gump. Followers will be moved to the ship along with you.\n\n:'''Disembark''': Speaking disembark while on a vessel will allow you to leave your current vessel. After speaking disembark, an aiming reticule will appear on your screen. You can then target land near you. This will move you off the boat and to your specified location. This transports followers off of ships as well.\n\n:'''Fire Left/Fire Port''': Fires a cannon volley from the port-side cannons. This is a criminal action if innocent creatures or humans are hit with the resulting cannon fire.\n\n:'''Fire Right/Fire Starboard''': Fires a cannon volley from the starboard-side cannons. This is a criminal action if innocent creatures or humans are hit with the resulting cannon fire.\n\n:'''Deploy the Cannons''': This will deploy all retracted cannons. Deployed cannons are vulnerable to enemy fire. However, cannons must be deployed in order for them to shoot at the enemy.\n\n:'''Retract the Cannons''': This will deploy all retracted cannons. Retracted cannons are immune to enemy cannon fire but cannot fire until deployed.\n\n:'''Take the Helm''': Allows you to steer your vessel with your mouse. This is only usable by unmounted characters.\n\n:'''Leave the Helm''': Relinquish control of the helm and revert back to normal boat command steering.\n\n:'''Scan The Horizons''': Opens a map that reveals enemy ships as a red dot. [[Tracking]] increases this range as well as the Crow's Nest [[Ship Upgrades|Ship Upgrade]]\n\n== Ship Combat ==\nBattling [[Ships]] has become more interesting with the introduction of [[Cannons]] firing [[Cannon Balls]]. You can load the [[Cannons]] and fire [[Cannon Balls]] at enemy vessels using the \"Fire Left\" or \"Fire Right\" commands. See [[Ship Commands]] for details. Firing on another vessel that has innocent players on it will flag each person on your boat criminal regardless of who issued the fire command.\n\nShip combat gets even more interesting through the use of items such as [[Ship Repair Kit]]s, [[Special Fishing Net]]s and [[Grappling Hook]]s and the upgrades that can be added to your ship. See [[Ship Upgrades]]\n\n== Repairing Ships ==\nWhen a ship has taken fire from another vessel, it becomes damaged. Enough damage will cause your ship to catch fire and will do continuous damage to those around it. Using a [[Ship Repair Kit]] can repair that damage. See [[Ship Repair Kit]]s for details.\n\n== Sunken Ships ==\nShips can be sunk if they've taken enough damage from enemy vessels. When a ship is sunk, it takes a few moments to sink to the bottom of the water and once it has reached that point, all players and creatures on board are killed. Dead players will be teleported to the nearest land mass. Any items on your corpses can be looted at the location where the ship sank and all the items in your hold fall into a retrievable chest in the water.\n\nNote that when your ship is sunk, it will be placed in your bank and may be replaced in the water at full health. Any loot in your hold will be gone and any [[Cannon Balls]] in your cannons will be lost.\n\nYou may not dock your boat when it is damaged.\n\n==Ship Upgrades==\n{| cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" width=\"90%\"\n! style=\"background-color:#000; color:#FFFFFF;\" | Upgrade\n! style=\"background-color:#000; color:#FFFFFF;\" | Description\n|- align=\"center\"\n| Crow's Nest\n| Increases the range of your \"Scan The Horizons\" command.
