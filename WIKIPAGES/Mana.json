The amount of [[Mana]] that a player has is dependent upon their [[Intelligence]] stat. The trade is equal. 100 [[Intelligence]] grants 100 [[Mana]]. Typically a Mage will have between 95 and 100 Mana depending on their template. \n\nMana is located in the Second bar in your Health bar. Double clicking the Health bar will show your actual [[Intelligence]].\n\nMana is gained more quickly through the [[Meditation]] skill, both passively and when invoked.\n\nMana regenerates more slowly when wearing heavy armors. It's advised that Mages wear only light armors such as Leather."
