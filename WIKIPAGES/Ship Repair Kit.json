They are used to repair [[Ships]] when they have taken damage. [[Ships]] take damage from enemy vessels when fired upon by [[Cannons]]. Your ship will begin to catch fire which ticks and causes damage over time. If you do not repair your Ship, it will eventually get sunk by continued damage. The [[Ship Repair Kit]]s allow you to repair said damage. Using a [[Ship Repair Kit]] on the Ship will begin to repair it. Any character movement will interrupt the process. These repair kits have uses, so interrupting the process could be costly.\n\n==Usage==\nYou can repair your ship by double clicking the [[Ship Repair Kit]]. You will be presented with a target reticle. Targeting any area of the Ship will bring up a gump displaying each area of the ships health. There is the Hull, Mast and left and right [[Cannons]]. The percentage of health remaining will be displayed. Clicking one of the icons will begin to repair the Ship.\n\nCharacter movement will interrupt the repairing process and consume a charge on the [[Ship Repair Kit]]. The ship will slowly repair until you have moved or the ship has been repaired. Ships cannot be docked unless at 100% health, so it is wise to carry one on a ship at all times.\n\n==Types==\nThere are two types of [[Ship Repair Kits]] that can be used on a ship. \n:'''[[Ship Repair Kit]]''': Repairs 1% Damage per Second\n:'''Superb Repair Kit''': Repairs 2% Damage per Second\n\n==Crafting==\n{| cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" width=\"90%\"\n! style=\"background-color:#000; color:#FFFFFF;\" | Repair Kit\n! style=\"background-color:#000; color:#FFFFFF;\" | Materials\n! style=\"background-color:#000; color:#FFFFFF;\" | Skill Required\n|- align=\"center\"\n| [[Ship Repair Kit]]\n| 100 [[Ingots]]\n| 85.0 [[Tinkering]]\n|- align=\"center\"\n| Superb Repair Kit\n| 400 [[Ingots]]\n| 105.0 [[Tinkering]]\n|}\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Ships]]\n*[[Ship Commands]]\n*[[Whirlpool]]s\n*[[Galleons]]\n*[[Ship Upgrades]]\n*[[Tinkering]]\n*[[Cannons]]\n*[[Cannon Balls]]"
