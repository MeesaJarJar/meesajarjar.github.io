Stamina is determined by the level of [[Dexterity]] which translate into your characters total [[Stamina]]. [[Stamina]] is depleted when your character takes damage, attempts to move when holding more than their maximum carrying weight or when your character passes through another character.\n\nAn enemy with [[Macing]] who strikes you with their mace can reduce your [[Stamina]] more so than other weapons or weapon skills. [[Stamina]] is also required for characters who choose to [[Stun]] and enemy. [[Stamina]] is the third bar represented on your characters status bar in the interface.\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Dexterity]]\n*[[Macing]]\n*[[Stun]]"
