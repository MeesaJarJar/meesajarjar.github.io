It will require that you collect 10 ancient smithing hammer shards. Once constructed you will be able to double click the hammer to see directions to find the quest giver in the '''Public Britain Library'''\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" class=\"right\">\nFile:LegendaryHammer.PNG|Legendary Hammer & Shards\nFile:LegendaryHammerText.PNG|Hammer Quest Text\n</gallery>\n\nOnce you return to the quest NPC with a completed hammer and double click him or say \"quest\" the quest box will come up. You will need to make sure the hammer is in your main bag layer. Once you hit okay he will place a notepad into your backpack and set you off onto the second step toward a soulforge.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" class=\"right\">\nFile:LegendaryHammerQuestPromptQ1.PNG|Soulforge Quest\nFile:NotepadQ2.PNG|Quest Notepad\n</gallery>\n\n== Step Two - Locating the scrolls ==\n\nFor the next part of the quest the NPC has tasks you with locating 5 different scrolls in various dungeons that will move you into the third part of the quest chain. The scrolls are located in the dungeons of Deciet, Destard, Fire, Hythloth, and Shame(Mage Tower by Poison Elementals)\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" class=\"right\">\nFile:DecietScroll.PNG|Deciet Scroll\nFile:DestardScroll.PNG|Destard Scroll\nFile:FireScroll.PNG|Fire Scroll\nFile:HythlothScrolll.PNG|Hythloth Scroll\nFile:ShameScroll.PNG|Shame Scroll\n</gallery>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" class=\"right\">\nFile:DecietScroll2Q4.PNG|Deciet Scroll Text\nFile:DestardScroll2Q4.PNG|Destard Scroll Text\nFile:FireScroll2Q4.PNG|Fire Scroll Text\nFile:HythlothScroll2Q4.PNG|Hythloth Scroll Text\nFile:ShameScroll2Q4.PNG|Shame Scroll Text\n</gallery>\n\n== Step Three - Transcribe notebook & Collect Materials ==\n\nOnce you have located all the scrolls your notepad will show five collected.\n\n[[File:NotepadProgress.PNG|275px|Notepad progress]]\n\nYou will then be able to return to the quest NPC and double click him to progress further.\n\n[[File:FurtherNotesQ5.PNG|275px|Updated Notepad]]\n\n[[File:FurtherNotes2Q5.PNG|275px|Additional Updates]]\n\nNow that your notebook is complete you will be able to validate the materials needed by double clicking the [[Legendary Hammer]]. It will bring up a quest window again with updated information that you had the NPC update just before.\n\n[[File:SoulforgeResourcesQ6.PNG|275px|Material list]]\n\nOnce collected the materials should look like this and '''NEED TO BE PLACED IN YOUR MAIN BAG LAYER AND DRAGON BONES SEPERATED ONE BY ONE'''\n\nYou will need 20 dragon bone shards, 2 intacted dragon hearts, 1 heart of rikktor, 1 soul of the harrower, 1 soul of the devourer, the notepad, and finally the [[Legendary Hammer]]\n\n[[File:SoulforgeResources2Q6.PNG|275px|Soulforge Materials]]\n\n== Step Four - Complete the Soulforge ==\n\nNow that you have collected all the needed materials and have them in your '''MAIN BAG LAYER AND BONE SHARDS SEPERATED ONE BY ONE''' you will be able to complete the Soulforge. You must pick out a place in your home that has available '''4x4 space''' that you will target. Now that you are ready and have an available spot for placement you will double click the [[Legendary Hammer]] and target the area you want it to be with the available space. It will then complete the soulforge!\n\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=\"250px\" heights=\"250px\">\nFile:SoulforgeCompleteJournalQ7.PNG|'''Journal Text'''<br />(click to preview)\nFile:SoulforgeFinalV3.gif|'''Completed Soulforge'''<br />(click to preview)\n</gallery>\n\n== Craftable Items ==\n\n\n'''Dimensional Archway'''\n\nThese can be dyed using an [[Dimensional_Archway##Dyeing_Archways|Dimensional Archway Dye deed]].\n\n[[File:LegendaryCrafting3.png]]\n\n'''Required Materials'''\n* Enchanted Marble x3\n\n\n\n\n'''Fireable Cannon (Operational)'''\n\n[[File:LegendaryCrafting4.png]]\n\n'''Required Materials'''\n\n* Stack of Logs x10\n* Muzzle Packer x1\n* Stack of Ingots x10\n* Cannon Fuse x1\n\n\n\n'''Suit of Silver Armor Decoration'''\n\n[[File:LegendaryCrafting5.png]]\n\n'''Required Materials'''\n\n* Stack of Ingots x20\n* Ancient Armor x10\n\n\n\n'''Suit of Golden Armor Decoration'''\n\n[[File:LegendaryCrafting6.png]]\n\n'''Required Materials'''\n\n* Stack of Ingots x20\n* Ancient Armor x10\n\n\n\n'''Singing Crystal Ball'''\n\n[[File:LegendaryCrafting7.png]]\n\n'''Required Materials'''\n\n* Sand x100\n* Seer's Powder x50\n\n== Links ==\n\n'''Click the Link below for a Video Preview of the Enchanted Archway:''' [http://screencast.com/t/EAlab5J5 http://screencast.com/t/EAlab5J5]\n\n'''Video Preview for Fireable Cannon (Note person must be standing in front of the cannon at least 2 tiles from house):''' [http://screencast.com/t/46rWBCk4V http://screencast.com/t/46rWBCk4V]\n\n'''''Original Thread:''' [http://uoforum.com/threads/legendary-crafting-changes.36958 http://uoforum.com/threads/legendary-crafting-changes.36958/]''"
