To see another player's flagging status look at their name, healthbar, or hovering over them while in war mode. The colour determines what will happen if you attack them.\n\n''Many thanks to the knowledgeable Sog for provided this guide.''\n\n=Colors Denoting Status=\n==Blue==\n[[File:flaggingblue.png|right|100px]]\n\nThis is the default status of players.  Characters will start [[Flagging#Blue|blue and stay blue]] unless they join a Guild, Alliance, [[Militia]], or if a player [[Flagging#Criminal_Activities|exhibits behavior that is criminal]], in which case they go [[Flagging#Grey|grey]]. Further, any character that attacks or harms a [[Flagging#Blue|blue player]] will receive a [[Flagging#Criminal_Flag|criminal flag]].  In town and under normal circumstances, a [[Flagging#Blue|blue player]] is able to call \"guards\" and the town guards will impart their swift form of justice on an [[Flagging#Aggressor_Flag|aggressor]].  Outside of guard protection a player must rely on their skill and wits to achieve a worthwhile form of retribution.\n\n==Green==\n[[File:flagginggreen.png|right|100px]]\n\nThis status denotes an \"ally\" status.  If part of a guild, a player will see themselves and allies as green.  Other innocent players who not part of your guild or alliance will still see your character as [[Flagging#Blue|blue]].  Players should be careful who they ally as allies are able to engage in friendly direct target damage and melee PvP. Explosion pots and fields do not work on green allies but other directly targeted spells and using melee to attack will damage a player's allies.\n\n==Grey==\n[[File:flagginggrey.png|right|100px]]\n\nA character will turn grey if they commit a [[Flagging#Criminal_Acts|criminal act]].  A character that is grey is eligible to be attacked without their aggressor having fear of taking a murder count. Town guards will not protect a grey player.\n\n\n==Red==\n[[File:flaggingred.png|right|100px]]\n\nRed characters are known as [[Player_Killing|player-killers or PKs]].  If a character does damage to another [[Flagging#Blue|blue player]] and then the [[Flagging#Blue|blue player]] subsequently dies (whether the aggressor delivers the killing blow makes no difference) the player may choose to \"count\" the aggressor.  \n\nFive [[Player_Killing#Murder_Counts|murder counts]] and a player will turn red.  A red status will always override a [[Flagging#Grey|grey status]] ie. A red player that commits an criminal action would technically have a [[Flagging#Grey|grey status]], but since the red status overrides all other status they will still appear red. If a red player is killed, their head can be removed by using a bladed item on the corpse and taken to a Town Guard to [[Bounty_System#Stat_Loss|'stat' a red]] for up to 48 hours or charge them a bounty in lieu of statting.  [[Player_Killing#Murder_Counts|Murder counts]] decay at a rate one per 24 hours of logged in time.  Additionally, reds are subjected to different than normal magical travel rules.\n\n==Orange==\n[[File:flaggingorange.jpeg|right|100px]]\n\nIf a player joins a [[Militia]], their enemies will appear orange.  These players are freely attackable and vice versa.  Run or fight.\n\n\n\n\n=Flagging=\n==Criminal Flag==\nAny [[Flagging#Criminal_Acts|criminal act]] will assign a player with a criminal flag for 120 seconds, if in town, you may type the words \"Guards\" and they will be summoned to swiftly dispatch all criminals.  A criminal flag can sometimes be confused with a [[Flagging#Grey|character being grey]].  The criminal flag will set a character's status to grey for 120 seconds after each [[Flagging#Criminal_Acts|criminal act]], however, the ability to call guards is limited to 15 seconds after the [[Flagging#Criminal_Acts|last criminal action]] a player committed.  Being flagged criminal also limits a characters ability to use the spells [[Recall]] and [[Gate_Travel|casting or entering a Gate]].  \n\n==Aggressor Flag==\nThe aggressor flag puts a character in a state of 'combat' any debuff, damage, or even aggressive barding act constitutes [[Flagging#Aggressive_Acts|an aggressive act]] and give an aggressive flag.  Aggressive flagging works the same way regardless of a player's status: red, grey, blue, orange.  An aggressive flag will freeze the status of both players at the time of combat; ie, if a [[Flagging#Blue|blue player]] attacks a [[Flagging#Grey|grey player]], the [[Flagging#Blue|blue player]] will see the [[Flagging#Grey|grey player]] as grey until the aggressor flag wears off and vice versa. Initiating and extending and aggressor flag will limit a character's ability to use the spells [[Recall]] and [[Gate_Travel|Gate]] for 30 seconds.\n\n===Attacking Grey Players===\nWhen a player (regardless of [[Flagging#Blue|blue]], [[Flagging#Grey|grey]], or [[Flagging#Red|red]] status) attacks a player with a [[Flagging#Grey|grey status]], without prior personal provocation, they initiate an [[Flagging#Aggressor_Flag|aggressor flag]] that will sustain the opposing [[Flagging#Grey|player's grey status]] for 120 seconds to the aggressor.  This status will be indefinitely extended as long as [[Flagging#Aggressive_Acts|aggressive actions]] are sustained.  However, the [[Flagging#Aggressor_Flag|aggressor flag]] also will flag the aggressive player grey to their opposition.  \n\nAs an example: Player A loots a [[Flagging#Blue|blue]] corpse, in a dungeon; he hides for 100 seconds, but is revealed and attacked by player B.  They continue to fight for the next 20 seconds: at which time, player A, globally, turns [[Flagging#Blue|blue]].  However, as long as player B sustains aggression and line-of-sight of player A, player B will see player A as [[Flagging#Grey|grey]].  \n\nAdditionally, when player B initiates the [[Flagging#Aggressor_Flag|aggressor flag]] on player A will see player B as [[Flagging#Grey|grey]] and may choose to turn the tables and extend their own [[Flagging#Aggressor_Flag|aggressor flag]].  Players would be wise to observe this caveat when deciding who to attack.\n\n===Attacking Blue Players===\nWhen a player (regardless of [[Flagging#Blue|blue]], [[Flagging#Grey|grey]], or [[Flagging#Red|red]] status) attacks a player with a [[Flagging#Blue|blue status]], they are [[Flagging#Criminal_Flag|flagged criminal]] and eligible to be [[Player_Killing#Murder_Counts|counted for a murder]] if their prey dies after they sustain damage directly caused by their attacker.  [[Flagging#Grey|Grey status]] and [[Flagging#Criminal_Flag|criminal flagging]] will be indefinitely extended as [[Flagging#Aggressive_Acts|aggressive actions]] are taken.  This actually works the same as attacking a [[Flagging#Grey|grey player]] and extending their previous status. ie. if the [[Flagging#Criminal_Acts|initial criminal act]] was an [[Flagging#Aggressive_Acts|aggressive action]] on a [[Flagging#Blue|blue player]] that player will remain [[Flagging#Blue|blue]] to his aggressor unless he commits [[Flagging#Criminal_Acts|a criminal action]].  In that particular case, it would depend on the expiration of the 120 second timers for aggressive vs. the aggressee's [[Flagging#Grey|grey status]] timer for his [[Flagging#Criminal_Acts|criminal act]] as to whether a [[Player_Killing#Murder_Counts|murder count]] could be given.  These rules are still true for a [[Flagging#Red|character that is red]], however, their [[Flagging#Red|red status]] makes it impossible to see their [[Flagging#Grey|grey status]].\n\nBy way of example: Player A, [[Flagging#Blue|blue]], attacks and damages player B, also [[Flagging#Blue|blue]], player A turns [[Flagging#Grey|grey]] but player B gets away.  A minute later player A returns now attacking player B.  If player B retaliates they will again be [[Flagging#Criminal_Flag|flagged as criminal]] and subject to [[Player_Killing#Murder_Counts|a murder count]] if applicable.  If player B now chooses to run, player A then may pursue and with each [[Flagging#Aggressive_Acts|aggressive action]] extend the [[Flagging#Grey|grey status]] of player B, but also keeping their [[Flagging#Blue|blue status]] globally and to player B. \n\nTo put this simply and in almost all cases: attacking a [[Flagging#Blue|blue player]] and succeeding in killing them will always make a player eligible to receive [[Player_Killing#Murder_Counts|a murder count]].  However, some people excel at [[Flagging#Exploiting_Flagging_Mechanics|exploiting flagging rules]].\n\nTo illustrate further: Player A is [[Flagging#Blue|a blue player]] and is just outside of Brit bridge: Player B is [[Flagging#Red|a red player]] and attacks Player A.  Player A can then run across the bridge.  If player B follows them into the guard zone still attacking or still [[Flagging#Criminal_Flag|under a criminal flag]] the guards could be called.  If player B stopped before the guard line, player A (still appearing [[Flagging#Red|as a red player]] to player B) could still lob spells or shoot arrows and force player B to retreat.   \n\n===Attacking Red Players===\nWhen a player (regardless of [[Flagging#Blue|blue]], [[Flagging#Grey|grey]], or [[Flagging#Red|red]] status) attacks a player with a [[Flagging#Red|red status]], without prior provocation, they receive an [[Flagging#Aggressor_Flag|aggressor flag]] making them grey to their red opponent.  Again this will last indefinitely as long as [[Flagging#Aggressive_Acts|aggressive actions]] are sustained.  And again, this is exactly the same way the [[Flagging#Aggressive_Acts|aggressive actions]] works in the other circumstances.  \n\nAs an example: A [[Flagging#Blue|blue player]] attacks a [[Flagging#Blue|red player]] outside of Moonglow.  The [[Flagging#Blue|red player]] will see the [[Flagging#Blue|blue player]] as [[Flagging#Grey|grey]] and be free to chase the [[Flagging#Blue|blue player]] through town. \n\n===Attacking Orange/Green Players===\nAttacking an [[Flagging#Orange|orange player]] is well within a player's rights and encouraged.  Attacking a [[Flagging#Green|green player]] is a way some [[[[Flagging#Exploiting_Flagging_Mechanics|exploit flagging rules]] and players should be weary of. Players attacking players with an [[Flagging#Orange|orange status]] or [[Flagging#Green|green status]] will have an [[Flagging#Aggressor_Flag|aggressor flag]] that will limit magical travel as is true with all other statuses; but also, limits a [[Militias|Millita Member's]] ability to enter [[Custom_Housing|homes]].\n\nAs an example: Player A is in a [[Militia]] and attacks Player B Pet, who is in a different [[Militia]].  Player A is assigned an [[Flagging#Aggressor_Flag|aggressor flag]] that limits the ability to use the spells [[Recall]] and [[Gate_Travel|casting or entering a Gate]].  He is suddenly swarmed by a 5 person [[Militia|Militia zerg]].\n\n=Criminal Activities=\n==Criminal Acts==\n* Attacking [[Flagging#Blue|blue players]] - whether a misclick, an errant spell, or intentional for any reason will assign a [[Flagging#Criminal_Flag|criminal flag]] to the aggressor.\n* Any beneficial act on a globally [[Flagging#Grey|grey player]] or [[Flagging#Red|red player]] - if a player heals or buffs a [[Flagging#Grey|grey player]] or [[Flagging#Red|red player]] they will be assigned a [[Flagging#Criminal_Flag|criminal flag]]\n* Looting a [[Flagging#Blue|blue corpse]] - whether monster, NPC, or another player looting a [[Flagging#Blue|blue corpse]] will give a player a [[Flagging#Criminal_Flag|criminal flag]]\n* Using provocation against [[Flagging#Blue|blue players]] - sending a monster to attack a [[Flagging#Blue|blue player]] will give the player a [[Flagging#Criminal_Flag|criminal flag]]\n\n==Stealing and Thieves==\nAny attempt at a [[Stealing#Thefts|Theft]] will make a thief 'perma-grey:' while they may appear as [[Flagging#Blue|blue players]] globally, they are actually freely attackable will reveal their [[Flagging#Grey|true grey status]].  If a player is the victim of a [[Stealing#Thefts|Theft]] they will see their thief as [[Flagging#Grey|grey player]] until they die.  Depending on the success of the attempt they may receive a [[Flagging#Criminal_Flag|criminal flag]].  See: [http://www.uoforum.com/threads/guide-thievery-101.42134/ Halygon's thieving guide].\n\n[[Stealing]] is NOT an aggressive act.  If a player attacks a [[Flagging#Grey|grey thief ]] the situation would fall under section: [[Flagging#Attacking_Grey_Players|Attacking Grey Players]].  If you attack a [[Flagging#Blue|blue thief]], not under 'perma-grey' conditions it would fall under section [[Flagging#Attacking_Blue_Players|Attacking Blue Players]], with the caveat that they are unable to give [[Player_Killing#Murder_Counts|Murder Counts]] to other players.\n\n=Aggressive Acts=\n* Attacking another player - attacking a player will assign an [[Flagging#Aggressor_Flag|aggressor flag]]\n* [[Controlling_Pets#Pet_Commands|Ordering Pets/Summons/Hirelings to attack]] - attacking a player will assign an [[Flagging#Aggressor_Flag|aggressor flag]]\n* Using [[Provocation|Provocation Skill]] to force something to attack - using [[Provocation]] against a player will assign an [[Flagging#Aggressor_Flag|aggressor flag]]\n* Using indirect aggressive spells - [[Flagging#Combat Engagement|engaging in combat]] through indirect aggressive spells such as spells with with delay(like [[Explosion]]), duration(like [[Firewall]], [[Poison Field]], or [[Paralyze Field]]) or uncontrollable summons such as [[Energy Vortex]] and [[Bladed Spirit]]\n\n=Combat Engagement=\nPlayers are not allowed to flee(or disengage) from a combat and will receive the \"Wouldst thou flee from battle?\" message when a player has been engaged in combat with another player.\n\nBoth players (the aggressor and the person being \"aggressed\") cannot recall or gate within 1-2 minutes of an aggressive action.\n\n[[Flagging#Aggressive Acts|Aggressive actions]] includes engaging in combat through War Mode, ordering pets to attack a target, using [[Provocation]] skill using indirect aggressive spells such as spells with with delay(like [[Explosion]]), duration(like [[Firewall]], [[Poison Field]], or [[Paralyze Field]]) or uncontrollable summons such as [[Energy Vortex]] and [[Bladed Spirit]].\n\nAt the time of the first [[Flagging#Aggressive Acts|Aggressive Attack]], a timer begins, and will continually reset every time another [[Flagging#Aggressive Acts|aggressive action]] is taken.\n\nThe aggressive timer stops when enough time has passed since the last [[Flagging#Aggressive Acts|aggressive action]], or one of the players involved in the combat dies.\n\nThe mechanic only applies to players that have had at least one [[Player_Killing#Murder_Counts|recorded murder count]] ever since the character's creation.\n\nIf the player belongs to a [[Militia|Militia Guild]], the aggressor can not enter a [[Custom_Housing|home]], however the non-aggressor can. [[Dimensional_Archway|Archways]] that are on screen from a [[Custom_Housing|house]] count as a player attempting to enter a [[Custom_Housing|home zone]] and may not be allowed to be in the area around the [[Dimensional_Archway|Archway]] even if that area is beyond the [[Custom_Housing|house plot]].\n\n=Exploiting Flagging Mechanics=\n==Ignorance==\nGenerally, this is the biggest reason why people fall victim to flagging mechanics.  A person will attack a [[Flagging#Red|red player]] assuming that running into town assuming guards will save them.  Or a [[Flagging#Grey|grey thief]] steals from them and they engage hoping to enact some retribution only to have the tables turned having their [[Reagents]] or weapon stolen from them and end up lying face down.  Players should pick their opponents wisely.  \n\n==Pets and Flagging==\n[[Player_Killing|Blue player killers]] sometimes use an expiring [[Flagging#Grey|grey status]] from [[Flagging#Criminal_Acts|a criminal action]] to goad other players into attacking.  This happens most often with mages as a [[Flagging#Grey|grey player]] will wander onto an opponents screen just as their [[Flagging#Grey|grey timer]] expires and getting 'closest' targeted.  Opposing players would become [[Flagging#Grey|grey]] and be eligible to be counted.  More advanced a [[Flagging#Blue|blue player]] that has attacked another [[Flagging#Blue|blue player]] and then runs away while their [[Flagging#Aggressor_Flag|aggressor flag]] expires, but commits another [[Flagging#Criminal_Acts|criminal action]] (like attacking their [[Flagging#Blue|blue horse]]) and then goading their victim back into attacking them under the flagging rules. \n\n==Timer Manipulation==\nSome players aggress other player's pets hoping that a tamer might seek retribution falling into a trap using the [[Flagging#Aggressor_Flag|aggressor flag]] described in section: [[Flagging#Attacking_Grey_Players|Attacking Grey Players]].  Players should avoid going afk with pets to avoid similar issues.\n\n==Pot/field/AoE jumping==\nPot jumping is mostly used by [[Flagging#Red|red players]] and [[Flagging#Grey|grey players]] to get an [[Flagging#Aggressor_Flag|aggressor flag]] from a [[Flagging#Blue|blue player]].  When a [[Flagging#Blue|blue player]] throws a pot at a [[Flagging#Red|red players]] or [[Flagging#Grey|grey players]], then another [[Flagging#Grey|grey ally]] or [[Flagging#Red|red ally]] might stand next to them so that the AoE damage gives the [[Flagging#Blue|blue player]] an [[Flagging#Aggressor_Flag|aggressor flag]]. Fields, AoE spells or abilities, and EVs work in the same manner.  As a player cannot control what will may run into their paralyze fields and  or what their EVs attacks.\n\n=Contributors=\nThe community would like to thank the following brave adventurers who contributed their time and experiences for others to enjoy:\n* Azria\n* Colin\n* Halygon\n* KARA Fatma\n* Parsnip\n* Phrygian\n* Sog\n* Vital Force"
