You may then target the pet you wish to store. [[Pack animals]] may not be stabled when loaded, and dead bonded creatures must first be [[resurrect]]ed.\n\nUsing the \"claim\" term allows you to retrieve as many pets as your control slots allow, though it is usually more practical to specify exactly which pet you wish to retrieve (for example, \"claim Keith\").\n\nYou may also say \"claim list\" (or request a pet you do not own, eg \"claim asdf\") to be shown a list of pets you currently have in the stable, from which you may select the desired pet.\n\n==Stable Slots==\nEach pet requires one stable slot, regardless of how many control slots they use. A typical (non-tamer) character has two available stable slots. Tamers, however, have a increased amount of stable slots based upon their combined taming abilities. The sum of the character's skills in [[Animal Taming]], [[Animal Lore]], and [[Veterinary]] determines the amount of additional stable slots according the following tables:\n\n===Base Stable Slots===\n{| border=\"1\"\n|-\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background-color:#000; color:#FFF;\" | '''Combined Skill Amount'''\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background-color:#000; color:#FFF;\" | '''Base Stable Slots'''\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background-color:#000; color:#FFF;\" | '''Skills Applied'''\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 0-159.9\n| align=\"center\" | 2\n| [[Animal Taming]], [[Animal Lore]], and [[Veterinary]]\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 160.0-199.9\n| align=\"center\" | 3\n| [[Animal Taming]], [[Animal Lore]], and [[Veterinary]]\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 200-239.9\n| align=\"center\" | 4\n| [[Animal Taming]], [[Animal Lore]], and [[Veterinary]]\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 240+\n| align=\"center\" | 5\n| [[Animal Taming]], [[Animal Lore]], and [[Veterinary]]\n|}\n\n===Bonus Stable Slots===\nAdditionally, \"bonus\" stabling slots are added for each of the three taming skills([[Animal Taming]], [[Animal Lore]], and [[Veterinary]]) that reach 100.0, 110.0, and 120.0. These \"bonus slots\" are cumulative, meaning each skill that reaches one of these milestones gets one more additional stable slot.\n\n{| border=\"1\"\n|-\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background-color:#000; color:#FFF;\" | '''Highest Skill Amount'''\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background-color:#000; color:#FFF;\" | '''Bonus Stable Slots'''\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background-color:#000; color:#FFF;\" | '''Skills Applied'''\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 100.0\n| align=\"center\" | +1\n| [[Animal Taming]], [[Animal Lore]], and [[Veterinary]]\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 110.0\n| align=\"center\" | +1\n| [[Animal Taming]] and [[Animal Lore]]\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 120.0\n| align=\"center\" | +1\n| [[Animal Taming]] and [[Animal Lore]]\n|}\n\nFor example, a person that has all three skills at 80.0 would have 5 stable slots. A person that had 100.0 Animal Lore and Animal Taming and Veterinary at 70.0 would have a total of 6 stable slots (5 for having 240.0+ skill and one bonus slot for having Animal Lore at 100.00).\n\n===Notes===\n* The maximum Stable Slots currently achievable with 120 [[Animal Taming]], 120 [[Animal Lore]], and 100 [[Veterinary]] is 12. 5 Base slots for 240+ Combined Skill, +3 for 120 [[Animal Taming]], +3 for 120 [[Animal Lore]], and +1 for 100 [[Veterinary]].\n* Use of the stable is a key factor in [[Controlling_Pets#Bonding|Bonding a pet]] to an owner.\n\n== Merchandise ==\n*Cat\n*Dog\n*Horse\n*Ridable Llama\n*Pack Horse\n*Pack Llama\n*Rabbit\n\n== Training ==\n[[Animal Lore]], [[Animal Taming]], [[Tactics]], [[Veterinary]], [[Wrestling]]\n\n=Contributors=\nThe community would like to thank the following brave adventurers who contributed their time and experiences for others to enjoy:\n* Sift\n\n==See Also==\n*[[Animal Taming]]\n*[[Animal Lore]]\n*[[Controlling Pets]]\n*[[Pets]]\n*[[Veterinary]]\n*[[Tameables]]"
