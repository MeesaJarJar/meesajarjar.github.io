Within these intricately carved stone chambers you may find:\n* A large stone Medusa face carved into the floor\n* Four sub-chambers \n* A secret exit\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" class=\"right\">\nFile:bootyislanddungeonlevel2entrance.png|Level 2 Entrance\nFile:bootyislanddungeonlevel2inside.png|Level 2\nFile:bootyislanddungeonlevel3entrance.png|Level 3 Entrance\nFile:BootyArch.png|Shankhill\nFile:BootyHydra1.png|Hydra\nFile:BootyMino.png|Minos\nFile:BootySphinx.png|Sphinx\n</gallery>\n\n==Dungeon Mini-Bosses==\nBy placing three Medusa statues in the dungeon, a dungeon encounter with a number of bosses is started. Players will be kicked out of the dungeon when this encounter begins. This is designed to be a challenging encounter for a larger guilder or organized group.\n\nUpon re-entering the dungeon, you must first kill 1000 mobs in the dungeon. A little counter will appear to show you the progress. Once you have killed 1000 monsters, four mini bosses will spawn and each will have a chance of a relic and power scroll. When all four mini boss have been defeated , the final boss also known as Medusa will spawn in her secret lair!\n\n* '''Hydra:''' No notable attacks but it has very high hit-points and defence  - Throw all your dragons at it!\n* '''Shankhill the Butcher:''' This wily foe has some of the same attacks as the [[Dungeon_Bosses#Arch_Demon|Arch Demon]] but does not drop any wards, shielded angels, or tentacles of the harrower.\n* '''Minos the Minotaur:''' This pet eater has the same attacks as the [[Random_Dungeon_Adventure#Minotaur_Champion|Minotaur Champion]]. He will also charge towards a random pet or player but he will stare in that direction, tipping you off to where he will charge.  Minos will one hit kill you within a 3-4 tile radius of his location and he will kill you even if you’re hidden or invisible.\n* '''Argelmach the Sphinx:''' Throws large boulders at random pets or players which causes a large amount of area damage. This effect is similar to Chain-Lightning, where if you stand by someone, more boulders come and hit them. Argelmach will also summon titans and giant beetles. And finally Argelmach will drop sand bombs that ticks for 40 damage if it explodes when you’re standing on it.\n* '''Medusa:''' Turns players/pets/summons into stone and then makes copies of them. Can also spawn summons on her own that can be dispelled (such naga, ogre lords, and wailed banshees) and shoot poison arrows across a long distance. Much like tentacles of the harrower, pets will not respond to an \"all kill\" command, you instead have to use \"all guard\".\n\nMany thanks to Medusa-slayers Koldes and Brom for providing information on the bosses!\n\n==Monsters==     \n{| border=\"1\" \"\n|-\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background-color:#000; color:#FFF;\" | '''Slayer Group'''\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background-color:#000; color:#FFF;\" | '''Monsters'''\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | [[Slayer_Types#Abyss|Abyss]]\n| align=\"center\" | Petrified Daemon\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | [[Slayer_Types#Humanoid|Humanoid]]\n| align=\"center\" | Amazon Priestess, Cursed Amazon, Juka Lord, Juka Mage, Juka Warrior, Petrified Troglodyte\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | [[Slayer_Types#Reptilian|Reptilian]]\n| align=\"center\" | Kappa, Medusa's Minion, Petrified Kappa \n|-\n| align=\"center\" | [[Slayer_Types#Undead|Undead]]\n| align=\"center\" | Bone Daemon, Bone Knight, Ghoul, Mummy, Petrified Bone Daemon, Petrified Lich, Skeleton, Wraith, Zombie\n|}\n\n=Level 3 - Inner Chamber=\n[[File:bootyislanddungeonlevel3.png|Level 3|Level 2|425px|thumb|right|Level 3 - Inner Chamber]]\nWithin the mouth of the large stone Medusa Face is another hidden staircase that lads to the Inner Chamber. This area is only available when [[Booty_Island_Dungeon#Dungeon_Mini-Bosses|all 4 mini-bosses]] have been killed and contains:\n* A pillar of evil energy used to access the Medusa Lair\n* Medusa's Lair\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" class=\"right\">\nFile:bootyislanddungeonlevel3entrance.png|Level 3 Entrance\n</gallery>\n\n==Dungeon Boss==\nBeware adventurers, [[Dungeon_Bosses#Bosses#Warlock|Medusa]] guards her lair and can only be accessed after all 4 dungeon mini-bosses have been slain! She is one of the many [[Dungeon_Bosses|Dungeon Bosses]] that inhabit the lands of Sosaria.\n\n==Monsters== \n{| border=\"1\" \"\n|-\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background-color:#000; color:#FFF;\" | '''Slayer Group'''\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background-color:#000; color:#FFF;\" | '''Monsters'''\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | [[Slayer_Types#Reptilian|Reptilian]]\n| align=\"center\" | Medusa's Minion \n|-\n| align=\"center\" | [[Slayer_Types#Undead|Undead]]\n| align=\"center\" | Lich, Skeletal Mage, Skeletal Knight, Wraith\n|}"
