Although cheap and plentiful they can be used to heal substantial amounts of damage and a character skilled in their use can even Cure or Resurrect targets without the use of magical abilities.\n\nThey can be obtained by using Scissors on Cloth (or Oil Cloth), buying them from NPC vendors, or by looting certain creatures (such as Mummies or Wandering Healers).\n\nBandages may be dyed, and those of the same color may be stacked. A pile of bandages weighs an amount in stones equal to 10% of it's quantity rounded up (eg. 763 bandages = 77 stones).\n\n==See Also==\n* [[Healing]]\n* [[Veterinary]]\n* [[Cloth]]"
