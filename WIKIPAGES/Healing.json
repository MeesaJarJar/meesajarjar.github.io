The Healing and [[Anatomy]] [[:Category:Skills|skills]] work together to determine how much damage is healed. A character can only heal targets that are standing 1 tile from them. Taking damage while healing will reduce the overall amount healed. Healing works with Dexterity for faster heal and cure times.\n\n'''The minimum and maximum amount healed is calculated as follows:'''\n:Min = [[Anatomy]]/5 + [[Healing]]/5 + 3\n:Max = [[Anatomy]]/5 + [[Healing]]/2 + 10\n\n==Requirements to Heal==\n* 60 skill in both [[Anatomy]] and [[Healing]] is required before a character can cure poison with bandages (80% chance to cure).\n* 80 skill in both [[Anatomy]] and [[Healing]] is required before a character can resurrect a ghost (25% chance to resurrect).\n\n==Timing==\nResurrecting others adds a delay of about 5 seconds to the Dexterity chart below. \n\nAt 100 Healing, poison adds a 2.5 or higher delay to the Dexterity chart below.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
